The underlying “scientific” basis for all environmentalism is the second law of thermodynamics or entropy. Environmentalist believe that entropy scientifically proves that we have peak oil problem, an over-population problem, a pollution problem, global warming and the myriad of other things environmentalist believe need to be fixed. It provides the moral basis for their argument that government must force people to quit using their cars, pro-creating, using ‘fossil fuels’, hydraulic fracturing, pesticides, irrigating, etc. According to environmentalists it also proves that technology can never solve these problems and the only solution is for humans to abandon technology and live in a “state of nature.” Entropy provides them the moral and scientific high ground in any debate and justifies any government intrusion into the private lives of people, including killing them.

Entropy causes things to become disordered according to environmentalists. One paper explains it this way:

Things fall apart because it's the Law: the Second Law of Thermodynamics also referred to as the Law of Entropy. Everything disintegrate, degenerate, shatter, fracture, split, tear, break up, break down, break, rust, die, decay, wear out, rip, or move from a state of order to disorder; not unless new energy is infused for regular maintenance and rebuilding of its structure.[1](#sdfootnote1sym)

The paper further explains, “Left unchecked, entropy will eliminate all life forms by randomizing vital life-sustaining molecules.” Jermy Rifkin, a leading environmentalist, has written a whole book about entropy, which argues that we need to use fewer resources to forestall the inevitable collapse of civilization. The most extreme version of this idea is called the heat death of the Universe [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe), which states that the Universe will end up with a uniform temperature and uniform distribution of matter. Human’s are accelerating this process, according to the environmentalists and the more humans there are and the more energy they use the faster this is accelerated. Their answer is fewer humans and less technology. I wondered how they would tie entropy to anthropomorphic global warming (AGW) their favorite crisis right now. One paper entitled _Entropy and Global Warming I_, explains the connection this way.

Population Growth and intense per capita energy consumption may be seen to be at the root of virtually all of the world's environmental problems. Global Warming, Depletion of Ozone Layer, Air Pollution, Ground Water Depletion, Chemical Risks, Pesticide Residue in Crops and in Fish.[2](#sdfootnote2sym)

It appears that the tie between entropy and AGW is over-population.

When I point out that environmentalists are anti-human most people think either I am wrong or that I am exaggerating. But consider the following examples.

A leading environmentalist, Dr. Eric R. Pianka advocated the elimination of 90 percent of Earth's population by airborne Ebola in front of few hundred members of the Texas Academy of Science who rose to their feet, and gave him a standing ovation.[3](#sdfootnote3sym) Dr. Pianka attempted to deny this, but the evidence was overwhelming including his student evaluations.

The DDT ban resulted in the death of over 100 million people. Alexander King, founder of the Malthusian Club of Rome, wrote in a biographical essay in 1990: “My own doubts came when DDT was introduced. In Guyana, within two years, it had almost eliminated malaria. So my chief quarrel with DDT, in hindsight, is that it **has greatly added to the population problem**.” [http://jiminmontana.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/environmentalism-the-green-religion-of-dehumanization/](http://jiminmontana.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/environmentalism-the-green-religion-of-dehumanization/).

Dr. Charles Wurster, one of the major opponents of DDT, is reported to have said, “People are the cause of all the problems. **We have too many of them. We need to get rid of some of them, and this (referring to malaria deaths) is as good a way as any**.” [http://jiminmontana.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/environmentalism-the-green-religion-of-dehumanization/](http://jiminmontana.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/environmentalism-the-green-religion-of-dehumanization/).

"A total population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal," Turner stated in 1996.[4](#sdfootnote4sym)

**Environmentalist killed over 100 million people in the 20****th** **Century – but they won’t be satisfied until they have killed at least another 5 billion people.**
