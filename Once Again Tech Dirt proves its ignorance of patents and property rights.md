Let me list the inaccuracies in the Tech Dirt story:

  

1) Tech Dirt Argues that innovation leads patents. The Industrial Revolution did not occur until there were property rights for inventors - It occurred where there were property rights for inventors, not in countries that allowed unlimited copying. Tech Dirt is so biased it can't see what is obvious on its face.

  

2) Reforms to the Patent System: While I don't agree with Judge Michel, Tech Dirt rolls out its usual non-sense about trolls. The Patent System was designed so that you could have a division of labor between inventors and manufacturers. Tech Dirt shows a surprising ignorance of economics in it is complaint about this division of labor. It also perpetuates the bad patent argument - which is always repeated by people who do not understand how the patent system works, can't read claims, make outrageous comments about what patents cover and are inherently opposed to patents under any circumstances.

  

3) Tech Dirt set up a straw man argument that companies should only get patents to promote innovation. People get patents because they want to protect their investment in creating and marketing new technologies. They do not want thieves to be able to free load off of their hard work. They are not getting patents to promote innovation any more than Tech Dirt exists to promote the first amendment or the useful arts (it clearly does the opposite).

  

4) Tech Dirt does not understand Property Rights: The crux of Tech Dirt’s argument against patents is that they are against property rights – they believe if technology is free to copy (steal) it will promote the development of new technologies. Patents are property rights. Whenever property rights are instituted you see an increase output and this includes patents. When modern patent systems were instituted there was an explosion in innovation called the Industrial Revolution. Those countries with weak or non-existent patent systems live on the edge of starvation and have no innovation (see North Korea, much of the Middle East and Africa).

  

TECH DIRT’s position is inconsistent with the facts, history, reason and logic.
