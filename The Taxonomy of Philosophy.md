Taxonomy is usually associated with biology. It is the science of classifying organisms according to their morphology, which is organisms form and structure. Unfortunately, most people group philosophers based on time and place they lived, such as David Hume and John Locke. This may be because that is how they studied them. Another common way people group philosophers is based on a single trait such as their political philosophy, such as Thomas Hobbes and Jean Jacque Rousseau under social contract theory. Perhaps the most confused grouping is enlightenment philosophers, which includes Hobbes, Francis Bacon, Francis Hutcheson, Ren√© Descartes, Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and Immanuel Kant. The only thing this group has in common is that are from roughly the same time period.

It is my goal to lay out a taxonomy that is better organized than most present categories of philosophers, based on the most fundamental ideas first. This will avoid the grouping of philosophers based on superficial similarities at less fundamental levels, such as grouping Ayn Rand with F. A. Hayek.

I am going to focus on the philosophers I think are having the greatest impact on ideas today. I am also approaching the subject from an Objectivist perspective. It is my hope that this will make philosophy easier to understand and organize. I realize that my categorizations are not going to be perfect and it is likely that the reader can improve or expand on this. I welcome all such comments.
