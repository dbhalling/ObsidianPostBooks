Yesterday the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the _**Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics**_ [No. 11-725](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docket_(court)) and once again proved that they are incompetent to rule on patent cases. The Justice made analogies to baseball bats and chocolate cookies in trying to understand this case involving genetic testing for breast cancer.

Asking these Supreme Court Judges to rule on this decision makes about as much sense as giving a child explosives (This analogy actual works – unlike the Justices). This would be funny if this case did not involve property rights worth billions of dollars and have the potential to destroy the biotech industry.

  

**THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT COMPETENT TO RULE ON PATENT LAW.**

  

The Justices on the Supreme Court neither have the scientific and technical training to rule on patent cases nor do they an appropriate understand of the basics of patent law. Congress has the power to limit the Supreme Court's jurisdiction and it should strip it of jurisdiction for patent cases.
