“Whenever the legislators endeavor to take away and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people.”

John Locke

  
  

The facts in this case are clear that the BLM has been waging a war to steal/destroy the Hammonds’ property based on a radical environmental agenda. This whole conflict originates around the BLM’s lie that grazing was damaging to wildlife. When Ms. Hammond found a federal study showing this was not true, the BLM declared war under their radical environmental agenda. The BLM tried to illegally build a fence around the Hammonds water source and they illegally interfered with the Hammonds’ access to their land. Then they illegally revoked the Hammonds water permits, then the BLM demanded the Hammonds fence in their cattle when Oregon is a fence out state. The court said the law did not apply to the BLM. Then the Hammonds started a back fire when a lightening created fire threatened their land. As a result, the federal government charged the Hammonds with terrorism and sentenced them to five years in prison.

The facts are overwhelming here, the government has “endeavored to take away and destroy the property of the Hammonds” and it is certainly within their Natural Rights to defend themselves against a government that thinks it is above the law. Let’s be clear here, the GOVERNMENT INITIATED FORCE IN THIS CASE.

If you tried to steal my land, acted like you were above the law, accused me of terrorism for starting a back fire on my own land, and then tried to put me in jail, I would start shooting at you also.

We also have to keep in mind the backdrop in which this situation is occurring. Government officials are given sovereign immunity and they regularly get away with lying, stealing, and ignoring court orders (Louis Lerner, State Department officials, Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, various IRS officials, the EPA in the toxic spill in Colorado, to name just a few). Police steal billions of dollars of private assets using civil asset forfeiture rules and according to some sources in 2014 the assets seized under this program exceeded the total value of all burglaries in the US. This is a time when the government is tracking and recording every electronic communication of every American, a time in which the government searches millions of innocent people because they want to fly, a time in which police routinely kill and injure innocent Americans without even receiving a slap on the wrist.

This is also a time in which it is almost impossible to believe what is said in the media. We know that the government regularly pays to get their side of the story out and even gets journalists fired who do not tow the line. Do not waste your breath (fingers) citing state sponsored media reports to me. They are not credible in this case and neither are court documents. Since prosecutors and government officials get away with lying because of sovereign immunity. The preponderance of evidence is overwhelming, the BLM and environmentalist are trying to steal all private property in the west and when it comes to the environmental agenda, the government and environmentalist have proven that they are willing to lie over and over and not even be embarrassed about it. As Thomas Paine said extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and the burden of proof is on the government here.

Let’s see if the government is willing to kill people to advance their environmental agenda.

  
  

  
  

  
  

  
  

PS: We already know they are as they killed over 100 million people by banning DDT and over 600,000 people and counting when they killed the nuclear power industry – not to mention golden rice.
