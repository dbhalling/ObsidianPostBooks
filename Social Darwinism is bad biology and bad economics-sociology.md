Social Darwinism is bad biology and bad economics/sociology. The “goal” of evolution is not competition, although there does have to be a selection mechanism, but maximizing life (converting the most energy into life). You do not maximize life by having one species or one member of a species take all. Both of these would reduce the amount energy being converted into life.

In economics the goal is not to have 500 firms creating model T’s, it is to have 500 firms all creating unique high value items (If everyone produced the same thing, what would be the point of trade). Human life (and then wealth as we escape the Malthusian Trap) increases as we create more inventions that allow us to live in different climates, for instance, or exploit new resources, just as different species maximizes the amount of life. I do not want to make the same thing as my neighbor. I want him to make some incredibly high value thing to me and I want to make some incredibly high value thing he wants. We want competition to be allowed because we don’t want to allow someone to become lazy (rent seeking). But competition is not what makes us wealthy.

I think the 100 meter dash is a good example of what competition (pure competition or competition for the same product) can accomplish. In 1891 the world record was 10.8 seconds. Today it is 9.57 or about a 13% gain. This would not support the quadrupling of human population over the same period of time.
