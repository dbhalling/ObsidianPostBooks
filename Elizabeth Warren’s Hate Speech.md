President Obama has picked up on Elizabeth Warren’s argument that “Nobody got rich in the U.S. on his own.” Warren argues that other people paid for the roads that the rich person’s factory uses, they paid for the schools their workers were educated in, and so on. This argument is a straw man argument. Nobody has ever argued that people get rich in a vacuum. All rich people have to interact with other people in the process of building their business – all meaningful economic activity involves interaction with other people.

What Warren is really attacking is the idea of the “self-made man” and individualism. But, the definition of self-man made is a person who created their wealth through invention, production and/or trade. The phrase “self-made man” distinguishes productive individuals from the wealthy aristocrats, those who inherited their wealth, or dictators who made their wealth by force. Note that the proper definition of a self-made man shows that Warren is being intellectually and morally dishonest in her statements that “no one got rich on their own.” It is clearly impossible to get wealthy without social interaction with other people and without using existing resources. Of course, that was her point – distort the definition of a self-made man and then show it is impossible. When the correct definition of a “self-made man” is used, then it is clear that Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, Michael Dell, Mary Kay, and millions of other American businessmen and women are “self-made men.”

  
  

A similar argument is made in the realm of inventions and patents by socialists. Opponents of patents suggest that no one creates anything new, because they ignore that every invention is a creation of known elements since you cannot create something from nothing – it’s called conservation of matter and energy. They ignore that only an individual can think and all inventions start by an individual thinking about solving a problem. Even an invention with multiple inventors is created by the individual thoughts of each inventor.

  
  

It is interesting that socialists like Warren and Obama would attack something that is uniquely American. Do they want to glorify the Aristocracy of the Old World and denigrate honest work? Their contempt of America’s unique history, individualism, and success demonstrates that they are not advocating policies that will produce success for the United States. In fact, they are advocating policies that will produce the decline of the United States and untold human suffering. Liberals are fond of talking about hate speech, well Ms. Warren is clearly using hate speech, hate of America, hate of achievement, and hate of human happiness. f

  
  

Elizabeth Warren’s “Nobody got rich in the U.S. on his own” is intellectually and morally dishonest.
