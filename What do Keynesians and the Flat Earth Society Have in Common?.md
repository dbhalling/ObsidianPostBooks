Both of them are impervious to facts – in others words they are religions. The Flat Earth Society maintains that the Earth is flat instead of sphere despite overwhelming evidence, starting with Eratosthenes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) measurement of the circumference of the Earth in 276 BC. **Keynesians continue to insist that government spending stimulates the economy.** They insist this is true despite the fact that if their ideas were true theft should also stimulate the economy. For instances, Keynesians assert that “food stamps” (now the SNAP program [http://hallingblog.com/nancy-pelosi-theft-creates-jobs-%E2%80%93-a-modest-proposal/](http://hallingblog.com/nancy-pelosi-theft-creates-jobs-%E2%80%93-a-modest-proposal/)) create economic growth. If this were true so would theft, since the recipient of the food stamps does not provide anything of value for the food they receive.

Perhaps this is just too theoretical for the true believers, such as Paul Krugman, who are mentally and reality challenged? Perhaps the empirical results are ambiguous and I am just being too tough on them? Well it turns out that a number of studies have looked at this issue. For instance, the study [http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/function.pdf](http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/function/function.pdf) _The Size and Functions of_

_Government and Economic Growth,_ shows that for ODEC countries the growth rate is inversely proportional to percentage of GDP spent by the government.[1](#sdfootnote1sym) Below are pair of charts from this study.

  
  

This bar chart shows the average growth rate of a country versus its spending as a percentage of GDP.

  
  

This is a scatter plot that shows the growth rate over ten years of a country versus its spending as a percentage of GDP at the beginning of the decade.

Based on these two charts it appears that the United States’ growth rate is lower than the average for ODEC countries with similar amounts of spending. My guess is that this is due to hidden tax of regulatory burdens and regulatory attacks on property rights.

Austerity Programs

**These charts make it unambiguously clear that austerity programs do stimulate growth.** However, raising taxes is not an austerity program. Raising taxes is like a family tightening their budget by asking their boss for a raise or a company cutting expenses by raising prices. A company that raises it prices as a way to close their budget during an economic downturn, is likely to see less revenue. In the case of taxes, the government is likely to see less revenue and less economic activity. The source of economic growth is increases in our level of technology. When people see their return for creating a new technology, or a business around a new technology, or just investing in new technology for their existing business, they are less likely to undertake this endeavour.

**However, the TRUE BELIEVERS of Keynes and Socialism are not interested in evidence.** As a result, you can expect President Obama to suggest that more government spending is necessary to growth economy and jobs in his jobs speech in September.
