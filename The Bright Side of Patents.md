We find that patent approvals help startups create jobs, grow their sales, innovate, and reward their investors. Exogenous delays in the patent examination process significantly reduce firm growth, job creation, and innovation, even when a firm’s patent application is eventually approved. Abstract

  
  

We find that patents help mitigate information frictions in the market for entrepreneurial finance in at least four ways: they alleviate investors’ concerns regarding startups’ ability to monetize inventions; they reduce information asymmetry by making it easier for entrepreneurs to disclose details of their invention to investors without fear of expropriation; they allow these details to be communicated more credibly; and they help startups signal their quality to investors.

  
  

  
  

  
  

  
  

Nonsense

Patents strike a delicate balance between the benefits of rewarding inventors and the costs of blocking future inventions (Nordhaus 1969). Whether the U.S. patent system strikes the right balance is currently the subject of much debate. P.4

  
  

Why would they cite Boldrin and Levine?

Yet, these benefits have been hard to establish empirically, leading Boldrin and Levine (2013) to observe: “There is no empirical evidence that [patents] serve to increase innovation and productivity.”

This is nonsense, the evidence is overwhelming. There is almost 100% correlation between those countries that lead in creating new technologies and technology dispersion and countries with strong patent systems. There also a very strong correlation between the richest countries on a per capita basis and those with strong patent systems.

I have written two books showing the overwhelming evidence that patent cause economic growth and increasing levels of technology. Boldrin and Levine’s have written a half-baked book that a freshman in college should be embarrassed to have produced.
