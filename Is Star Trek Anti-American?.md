Is the Prime Directive from the science fiction television show Star Trek American? Is it sound foreign policy?

The show centers on the adventures of the starship Enterprise whose mission is to explore space for new life forms and new civilizations. In their explorations they are bound by the Prime Directive of the United Federation of Planets, which requires that the Enterprise not interfere with the “normal cultural evolution” of alien cultures. Star Trek was the brain child of Gene Roddenberry, whose state goal was “to have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement”, according to Wikipedia.

  
  

The prime directive states:

“As the right of each sentient species to live in accordance with its normal cultural evolution is considered sacred, no Star Fleet personnel may interfere with the healthy development of alien life and culture. Such interference includes the introduction of superior knowledge, strength, or technology to a world whose society is incapable of handling such advantages wisely. Star Fleet personnel may not violate this Prime Directive, even to save their lives and/or their ship unless they are acting to right an earlier violation or an accidental contamination of said culture. This directive takes precedence over any and all other considerations, and carries with it the highest moral obligation.”

  
  

The associated prohibitions are given below:

  
  

1. Providing knowledge of technologies or science

2. Taking actions to generally affect a society's overall development

3. Taking actions which support one faction within a society over another

4. Helping a society escape the negative consequences of its own actions

5. Helping a society escape a natural disaster known to the society, even if inaction would result in a society's extinction.

6. Subverting or avoiding the application of a society's laws

7. Interfering in the internal affairs of a society

  
  

It has been argued that the Prime Directive states the ideal foreign policy. That if the United States and the West were to follow this we would not have been dragged into wars in the Middle East and that the Prime Directive is consistent with President Washington pronouncement that the United States not get entangled in Foreign Wars. It does have a ring of Ron Paul’s foreign policy. , In an article in Foreign Policy magazine entitled, [Would Captain Kirk Intervene in Syria](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/01/would-captain-kirk-intervene-in-syria/) the author argues that the US should not interfere in Syria because it would disrupt their “normal cultural evolution” of Syria.

I think the Prime Directive is supposed to sound scientific. You are to observe, but not disturb. That may be fine if you are conducting a scientific experiment, however it is not a foreign policy. Note even the presence of a star ship is assumed to affect a society.

What would one of America’s Founding Fathers, John Locke (or Jefferson?) say about the Prime Directive?

What would philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand say about the prime directive?

My guess is that Rand would ask what is “normal cultural evolution.” Is it normal cultural evolution to allow Rachel Carson to convince countries to ban DDT and cause 100 million deaths? Is it normal cultural evolution to allow Mao to institute the cultural revolution that will starve over 30 million people to death? There is no such thing a normal cultural evolution. But it rings of Marxist ideas of a scientific progression of society.

Then Rand would ask why normal cultural evolution is considered sacred. According to the dictionary sacred means “connected with God (or the gods) or dedicated to a religious purpose and so deserving veneration.” Rand would reject anything based on an appeal to a deity. I see no reason that cultural evolution could rationally be considered to have any value, let alone be sacred.

It is clear the Prime Directive is based on faith, not reason. I will not take on the rest of the directive but look at the prohibitions. The first prohibition is “Providing knowledge of technologies or science.” Given that directive was directed to ALL species that are “able to perceive or feel things” this is almost meaningless. Most species that are able to perceive are not able to understand or take advantage of technology.

But what about rational beings? Why would you not provide knowledge of technologies or science? Does this mean we cannot teach our kids science and technology? That would clearly be immoral. Your objection might be that they are within our culture, but what about African cultures? Should we have not introduced DDT, or steam engines, or the Internet? While we have no obligation to introduce these sciences and technologies, to purposely prohibit them would seem to be immoral.

All the prohibitions and the prime directives are based group think (and written by Hollywood TV writers!). The word society is mentioned nine times in the Prime Directive and in the prohibitions. Individual is not mentioned once. Societies are based on a collection of people and only have rights based on the rights of the individuals, who make up the society, but none separate from them. I doubt that the Founding Fathers or John Locke would have been impressed by the Prime Directive.

People have argued that this misunderstands that the staff of the Enterprise work for Star Fleet and therefore have to follow orders. The Prime Directive is either moral or immoral and the Nuremberg defense does not change things.

  
  

Star Trek was American in spirit (Sputnik, Apollo etc.), and American in its insistence of including a multi-racial cast. I was ahead of its times in the 60s. But then it became profoundly anti-American, and stays that way.
