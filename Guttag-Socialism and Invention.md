**INTRODUCTION**

In 1915, an interesting collection of essays was published under the title, Inventors and Money-Makers. The author was F. W. Taussig, a very distinguished economist at the time. Using

the context of a "capitalistic" economic system, Taussig attempted to explain why inventors contrive and what their relationship was to the businessman, the "money-maker." He was able to find a number of interesting generalizations such as the importance of gain and profit to the inventor, the insignificance of "al­truism" as a motive, etc. However, near the end of Inventors and .Money-Makers he asks, "How shall your collectivist society achieve the same result?"1 Although he does not answer the question the importance of it is clear as he next says, "The question may not be unanswerable; but it i**s** not to be lightly brushed aside."2

It is unfortunate that Taussig formulated his essays before the Russian Revolution of 1917 as his views on the development of patent law in Soviet Russia would probably have been very stimulating. In truth, the question of "how shall a collectivist society achieve the same result" was "unanswerable" for him because there was no significant example of "socialism" to look

at and measure; all he could do was speculate. Today such a model has existed for over fifty years In the form of the USSR. In spite of such an excellent model, very little has been said about Soviet patent history in its entirety and, I feel, none of the explanations are totally satisfactory in answering Taussig's question. They are either too limited in time or too limited in

scope to determine a reasonable answer.

Nor can the question be simply "brushed aside," as it is now far too important as the recent rash of technological exchange between the U. S. and USSR points out. In addition, the patent law of most Eastern bloc countries, even Red China, have been substantially influenced by the patent law of the Soviet Union. To ignore Soviet patent law is to ignore much of the worldts patent law. For better or for worse the question of patent law and "collectivism" has to be dealt with Even as I write today, a "new" Soviet patent law is to take effect January 1, 1974 which, among other things, raises the chairman of the USSR Com­mittee for Inventions and Discoveries, the equivalent of the U. S. Commissioner of Patents, to minister in the USSR Council of Yin­isters. Clearly the USSR does not take its patent law lightly; nor can the U. S. do the same with Soviet patent law.

My ultimate purpose is to explore Soviet patent law and its history since 1919 in light of Taussigts proposal. However, the problem of a "collectivist" society and invention really involves two questions, not one. The first is how, given an economic system of socialism, does the society or state provide incentive and protection to the inventor for his innovation? Western capitalism and the Tsarist government before the Revolution found the patent to be a satisfactory means for accomplishing the above objectives. Such might not be the case in a society ruled by something closer to a command economy, as in the instance of the USSR.

The second question is in some ways related to the first, yet has certain qualiti7es of its own. Onuithe collectivist

society has established a "socialist" patent law, how does it fit itself into the international patent framework, especially when its system of protection of inventive spirit differs sub­stantially from that of the other countries involved? Such a situation eventually faced the Soviet Union by the late 19501s. Much of their effort during the 1960's and 1970's was directed towards solving it. As they found out, to get at the whole probLem of socialism and invention, both the "external" as well as the "internal" question had to be answered.

For ease of handling, I have divided Soviet patent history into seven sections, with each division corresponding to a major new law. The one exception is "Soviet Accession to the Paris Convention," the reason for which will become apparent later on. Each section will be discussed in three stages. The first will

deal with the important points of each law and will ask what factors such as ideology, economics, politics, foreign pressure, etc1 influenced it. Special attention has been paid to the economic events surrounding the 1919. 1924 and 1931 laws because of the particular importance of the developing Soviet economy in its relationship to these patent laws. The second will concern the historical developments of the patent law during the time period, especially those acts which were either added to help strengthen the law or those policies which were inconsistent with its meaiing. Finally, the role of the inventor, both Soviet and foreign, will be explored and the problems that arose during each period will be dealt with, especially where they signaled the need for a new law. There will be quite a bit of overlap and interrelation because **it is** often difficult to find the dividing line between

each stage.

_The_ search is not an easy one as the information about Soviet patent law and patent history, particularly in the years before 1941, is often skimpy. However, enough has been printed or translated so that someone with a basic knowledge of patent law plus general Soviet history can study and understand the subject. All of the Russian and Soviet statutes on patents are

now available in excellent English translations. The major

Soviet journals concerned with patents and patent law are accessible to the Western world. Good statistical information on Soviet patenting in the years after 1956, and, in certain instances, before 1941, can be found in various patent and economic journals, most notably Industrial Property and the Journal of the Patent Office Societz. A thorough effort in the right areas will yield the needed data,

The present paper makes no pretentions of being the last word on Soviet patent law. The subject has yet to be discussed in all its facets and angles. Worthy examples are the licensing and technological exchange between the USSR and the West and the influence of Soviet patent practice on patent protection in the Eastern bloc countries. A comprehensive study of patent law in China (it does exist), both before and after 1949, is very much needed. Encompassing As it is, the two-pronged question of socialist protection for invention is just a small part of the problem.

As so often happens in a study of this nature, many things will be left out or dealt with very briefly. Where possible, T have indicated with footnotes articles which may be Of interest but were only looked at in passing. At the end of this paper,

have tried to compile an extensive, general bibliography of those articles and books in English on Soviet patent law to form a basis for other researchers who would like to pursue certain areas in more detail or push the present topic even further. There **is still** much to be discovered and learned.

,----. I. SOCIALISM, INVENTION AND TSARIST RUSSIA

Since this is a background chapter, I would like to define

a few important terms before getting into the problem of "Social­it41, Invention and Tsarist Russia." The term "patent" by itself will be defined in its classical sense of providing protection for "industrial property" with the inventor having the sole right of exploitive use of the inventiontwhile the phrases "patent law," "patent involvement" and "patenting" will be used to describe any system that provides protection for inventive spitit, A "license" is a contract where the owner of a "patent" allows third parties to use the invention. "Socialism" will be defined in the economic sense where the state, for the most part, determines how scarce resources are to be allocated as opposed to "free- enterprise" where the market essentially determines such allocations.

When the Bolsheviks came to payer in 1917, they had two traditions to draw from in formulating Soviet patent law. One was the history of patent law and invention in Tsarist Russia up to 19171 The other was the socialist tradition as exemplified by Marx and Engels. Each had the possibility of playing a part in the development of Soviet patent law.

Information on pre-Soviet patent law and invention is even harder to find than that on Soviet patent law. The first "patent" law was formulated in 1812.3 Before this time, the Imperial government had allowed certain patents similar to the monopolies granted by Great Britain to various trading companies. This first law, "On the Privileges for Various Inventions and Discoveries

in Arts," rendered some order to the older procedure. However, the protection applied was in the form of a "privilege," not a patent, which probably made it more limited and conditional in nature. In addition, the granting of a "privilege" was optional; the examining body for applications, the State Council, was under no obligation to issue the protecting documents. Finally, each "privilege" was to be enacted as a special law.

Two improvements were made in the 1812 law. The first came in 1833 when a system was provided for preliminary examination of applications. But the optional and "privilege" character was retained. The second modification was adopted on March 30, 1870. The protective document was still called a "privilege." However, the law established the obligation to grant it if the application satisfied certain basic requirementsiwith the issuing function to come under the Ministry of Finance. In all but its name, the former "privilege" had turned into a patent.

In 1896, Russia normalized its protection for inventions by enacting'its first patent law in both word and fact.4 Like most of the civil legislation in Imperial Russia, it was heavily influenced by the patent laws of Europe, especially those in Germany. The law itself had a few important features. Patents on inventions and improvements were to be granted to both Russian subjects and foreigners (Art. 2). Patents were not granted for those things which consisted of scientific discoveries and abstract theories (Art. 4). The last article is not extraordinary until one considers that "discoveries" are now covered as a new form of protection in the Soviet law of 1959. The most important provision is Article 22 which gave -Lh_e__E ten_ta.**t****.****'****,****_h_t_c_Lccilus,****i**iht to

work the patented invention. The patentee had to work the patent within five years of the grant (Art. 24), could not be exempted from this provision by the grant of a patent (Art. 23), and if Article 24 **was** violated, the patent would cease in force (Art. 29 (3)). It must be added that in most other countries the time limit was two to three years, so the Russian provision was really quite generous.

Other provisions in the 1696 law were the heavy annual taxes to be collected on the patent while it was in force and inclusion

of Article 176 of the Industrial Law which said that no patent would be granted inventions, etc. Concerning munitions of war except where a private individual could use such an article and then only if it would have no force against the Ministries of War and Navy, nor could it preclude such Ministries from using it. In 1911, a new patent law was proposed but never came into being.5

How did the inventor fate under such a system? Perhaps a better question would be, "did invention exist at all in pre Soviet Russia?" A survey of information available suggests that little attention has been paid to subject and the data gathered

is often of questionable value. Most economic histories on Tsarist Russia ignore the question entirely. Curiously enough, even the few books and articles on Russian science say very little about Russian invention. In this aspect of Tsarist society, there seems to be a significant void.

Two people have made some reference to the subject. The eminent Soviet economist, Pi Lyashchenko, considered the problem In his book on pre-Soviet economic history.6 He states that fsarism and serfdom suppressed all manifestations of personal

_9_

Initiative and invention:7

The influence of serfdom on the development of independent scientific-technical thought in Russia proved to be still more detrimental. Tsarism and serfdom suppressed all manifestations of per­sonal initiative and invention Candj did not **a****lk****am_****E****nel_lig** not create the technical culture necessary for capitalism.

He goes on to say that Russia still produced several talented men. However, the circumstances were unfavorable for the development of independent technique of the Russian inventor for the follow­ing reasons: (1) Russian industrialists preferred to incorporate foreign methods and machinery rather than expend resources on new Russian inventions; and (2) the influx of foreign engineers and technicians as competitors along with their technology. Another source seems to confirm this view as well:8

• . . Foreigners would seek to stay on the international technological frontier in Russia, but they looked outside the country for exper‑

imentation and innovation . . Alternative, technologies to those in use in home LToreigner'sj

plants were rarely considered . • e

For the most part Russian inventors found application of their ideas abroad rather than in Russia.

A second point-of-view comes from an excellent two-volume study, Science in Russian Culture, by Alexander Vucinich. It

is one of the few books, English or Otherwise, that takes an in- depth look at the problem of Russian science, scientific thought and its relation to Tsarist society. Although the sections on

Russian invention and inventors are brief and scattered, they do much to fit more pieces to the growing puzzle of inventiveness in pre-Soviet Russia.

The first evidence of inventive activity in Russia was found in the 18th century in the form of "self-taught" inventors.9 They were "self-educated exponents of science," who "combined the fo14g! science of the countryside with the spirit of modern science." From their description, it is apparent that these inventors came from the lower estates of Russian society, usually the artisan classes. They had little or no academic training,

but gained their knowledge by reading the popular scientific journals published through the Academy of Sciences. Naturally, their con­tribution was to the field of industry although it was felt that they had enough inborn ability to help with other problems as well.

Three notable men arose from this unusual 18th century class, as also indicated by Lyashchenko.10 The first was I. I. Polzunov, author to a steam engine constructed for the Bnrnaul mine between 1763 and 1766. The next example was K. D. Frolov, remembered as a designer of water-powered plants in the Urals and Altai and inventor of various hydraulic innovations. The last was I. P. Kulibin, a self-educated master of mechanics whose ornamental time pieces were bought by Catherine the Great.

Apparently, there were hundreds of "unknown" inventors like the above with the government showing a somewhat appreciative attitude towards them. For his efforts, Polzunov received from Catherine 11 praise as well as occasional stipends and promotions. FroIolt was simllarily acknowledged. Even though Kulibin was to be disappointed over his dream of a bridge across the Neva River,

he gained the respect of such learned men of physics and mathematics as Euler and Bernoulli in addition to a government reward of 2000 roubles.

However, these "self-made" men had their problems as well, not the least of which **was** denial to them of university training in theoretical and applied science. The Russian aristocracy remained generally uninterested In both natural and mathematical sciences. Yet at the same time, they sought to and did exclude the lower classes from higher education:11

, In the proposal for the founding of Moscow University (1755), it was stated that enserfed persons should be admitted neither to the university ner to its gymnasium because the sciences are respected as noble pursuits and tolerate no coercion.

_While_ having the aptitude to go on to higher education, the self-taught inventor unfortunately fell into this excluded class.

Various intellectual quarters condemned the restrictions. The brilliant scientist and linguist, M. V. Lomonosov, a an not unfamiliar with class prejudice, claimed that such an attitude must go in order to utilize the intellectual resources of these self-taught inventors. However, their inventive potential remained dormant and was likely to stay that way until they were given access to adequate technical schooling. They were respected but not accepted by higher society,

In the 19th century, Russian science went through "radicaliza­tion" similar to that in Russian philosophical thought. Discussion of sciences role in society and particularly its relation to in­dustry became a central topic. However, the conclusions were

b

enthusiasm to use the latter as a source of science and technology.18

oth disheartening and discouraging. One prominent nihilist philosopher, D. 1, Pisarev, lamented the Russian's "inborn dis­regard for the practical value of science" as well as the alarming discovery that most scientific studies were directed to learned societies outside the country rather than at the practical solution **of** problems in Russian industry .12 In 1879, the famous Russian chemist Markovnikov noted an absense of profitable and beneficial ties between science and industry.13 A final comment comes fm D. Mendeleev who made the sad observation that in the 1880's Russia still **was in** need of a bridge between theoretical science aYld industry)4

There were several organizations that became concerned with the problem. In 1866, the Russian Technical Society was formed with the purpose of closing the gap between science and industry)

in addition to improving technological literacy among the workers.15 It put out various technical journals, for the most part read only by the self-taught inventors. Oddly enough, they were ignored by the industrial enterprises. A meeting of the Congress of Russian Naturalists and Physicians in St. Petersburg in 1867 revealed that a common theme among their papers was that science was the only avenue for improving the **social** condition of Russia.16 Lastly, the Ledentsov Society in 1909 began a program of research in areas of interest to both science and industry.17

The joining of invention and industry ran up against a pe­culiar snag. For some unknown reason, Russian entrepreneurs and scientists existed in a disharmonious relationship to each other. The former tended to rely on trade secrets while displaying little

Undoubtedly, it explains the previously mentioned lack of interest by industry in the economic journals. Another such criticism came from V. A. Mikheltsou in 19161who stated that the Russians might have discovered several worthy inventions if industry and society had been willing to give the necessary support.19 He cited A. N. Lodygin, inventor of incandescent lighting and A. S. Popov, creator of a device **similar** to a-wireless telegraphlas examples of men who had failed to receive the necessary financial backing to

develop their inventions. In conclusion, Mikhel'sou noted the traditional uncooperative attitude between Russian industrialists and scientists and hoped for improvement in the future.

Efforts by the Russian inventor to protect his invention would not reflect a favorable opinion on Tsarist patent law. Figures on patenting in pre-Soviet Russia come from two different sources. According to Lyashchenko;the total number of Russian patents issued to "Russian" inventors)up,to 1917, was24,992 as compared to 248,006 total patents issued in Germany and 1,034,227 in the U. S., although what is meant by "Russian" is not too clearly indicated.20 Another tabulation (see appendix) in which I would put more reliance would compute a total of something over 29,000 patents issued in Russia from 1841-1912. For the span of 1901-1912, the table is broken down into individual categoties. From my own computations of the data, it appears that 77% of the patents issued from 1901-1912 were to foreign inventors, with a high of 83% in 1901 decreasing to 67% by 1912. Thus Russian inventions amounted to less than 25 of the total patents in Imperial Russia.

Most authorities who make any comment (usually unsupported) on

invention in Tsarist Russia say that such activity was, at best, ignored by the government:21

It is also true that the Russian government in the latter part of the nineteenth century was notoriously indifferent to scientific progress;

that the work of Russian scientists was not properly utilized or publicized.

Others feel that invention did not exist in Tsarist Russia. Such a view is expressed by Turgenev in Chapter 33 of his novel, A House ol_Gentld-folk:22

Russia has fallen behind Europe; **we** must drive her on. It is maintained that we are young --that's nonsense. Moreover **we** have no inventive­ness; Homakov himself admits that we have not even invented mousetraps. Consequently, whether, we will or no, we must borrow from others.

And then there is Lyashchenko who came to the dismal conclusion that Tsardom suppressed all Russian inventiveness.

The above statements all have element of truth. My own feeling is that invention **in** pre-Soviet Russia formed a very small part of the total activity of Russian society and contributed very little to its economic well-being. The conclusion is based upon the apparent dominance of foreign patenting in Russia plus general evidence which suggests that outside of the self-taught inventors, inventive activity was deficient in Tsarist Russia.

There seem to be two reasons for the above situation, some points of which have been touched on before. The first **was** a socio-educational problem. While forming the most educated group in Russian society, the aristocracy was generally uninterested in

the practical aspects of science. Yet until 1900, Popular education was denied to the masses in whom inventive spirit seemed to exist. The university curriculum itself was hardly conducive to practical application, as the focus was on pure, theoretical science, if it was td7tight at ail. Even these discussions faced frequent governmental interference. The inability to obtain adequate technical instruction proved an immense stumbling block. In addition, the government's ambivalent attitude of modernization

for improving the military, yet affirming the ways of autocracy and class hierarchy, _was_ detrimental to the idea of individual initiative so important in invention.

A second problem involved the peculiarities of the Russian industrial revolution, both its lateness and the large amount of foreign capital necessary to bring it about. Industrial activity was quite **low** until Witte instituted his program of railroad building in the 18901s. Up to that time, the inventor found only a small market for his wares. He had to wait for industry to grow.

But the inclusion of foreign capital to start heavy industrial­ization meant that substattial amounts of foreign expertise followed as well. The Russian inventor was forced to compete

against not only his fellow colleagues but outside, better equipped intruders also. Even if his invention was superior, he had to overcome the enigma of traditional distrust between industry and science.

Although one would be hard put to prove that Russian patent law **was** more favorable to foreign inventors as opposed to their Russian counterparts, I suspect that the law of 1896 was, in part,

Instituted as one of the moves to encourage both foreign invest­ment and technology to come to Russia. The patent statistics of 1901-1912 seem to support the contention. It was certainly not a happy time for Russian inventiveness. Russian science and know-how was more a "show-case piece" for the government than a usable tool for industry.

The Bolshevik regime undoubtedly found the state of the Russian inventor extremely unsatisfactory. Patenting in Russia was in the almost eusive possession of foreign inventors. While not opposing Russian inventive spirit, Tsarist patent law had done very little encourage it. The new rulers were forced to consider alternatives.

This brings us to the second tradition, that of socialism, especially its relation to inventions as stated by Earx. However, to try to find a correlation between what Marx said and what the Bolsheviks put into use is a dangerous practice. But similarities between Marxian thought on invention and Soviet practice of patent law are so good that I feel_ the risk is justified.

Unfortunately the socialists of the 19th century had either very little or nothing to say about patents. Most of the patent systems in the major industrial countries were still in a very crude state when Marx was writing Capita/. So the search must

go beyond to words such as invention, incentive, industry, science and technology. And it is there that information possibly relating to patents can be found.

The search goes as far back as the Utopian Socialists. Saint-Simon and his disciple, Pecqueur, talked of the use of applied science as a basis for social organization. Such a social

-17-

system was often called a technocracy. They believed in science as a means for the advancement of society. But the next comment on invention and socialism was to be absent until Marx.

In spite of the voluminous nature of Marx's major work, CaDital, it is only on page 124 of the thitid volume that he writes a significant amount on invention.23 But what he wrote was quite important. He defines scientific labor such as inventions and discoveries as "universal labour," as "labour conditioned on the co-operation of living fellow beings and on the labours of those who have gone before." But then he goes on to say:

It is, therefore, generally the most worthless and miserable sort of money-capitalists who draw the greatest benefits out of universal labour of the human mind and its co-operative

in society.

Before I comment on the problem of invention in Capital, I would first like to lay down what Marx had to say on science

24

In general. Marx was interested in science not only for its value in philosophy but also its close connection to industry.25 He felt science itself was a product of the social industrial forces which it served.26

In addition, only through the working class could it be effectively used.27 Perhaps the next statement is the most explicit of all;28

Science must not be a selfish pleasure. Those who are so lucky as to be able to devote themselves to scientific pursuits should be the first to

221 their **knowledle** at the service of mankind.

I feel it is safe to say that )(arl Marx would not have spoken too highly of patents if he had had the time or the wish. His general dislike for private property, his feeling that the "univer­sal labour" of mankind was only used to further the interests of the "capitalists" and that scientists should exhibt a kind of "altruism" would not bode well for a favorable opinion of pro­tection for "industrial property." I can almost see the furious Marx put together the fact that a patent is an invention (universal labor) to be **2E2**121121 by a sole inventor (a monolp).ist).

Friedrich Engels says pretty much the same in his essay, "Critique of a Political Economy." In a chapter on factors of production, he states that most economists list only two factors,

covi

landAhuman labor, and forget the third !the mental element of

thought and Invention.29 He goes into a tirade of how economists ignore inventions in their calculations and how)If society were organized in a reasonable manner, the mental element would be accepted as a cost of production. He states that "the promotion of science brings its natural reward" and cites the Watt steam engine. However, in the summary of "Critique of a Political Economy," Engels concludes that capital and land use technical knowledge against, rather than for, labor, that the advantages accrued through new machinery are "illusory" and that the new technology generally makes the workers condition more miserable. 30

That is all that can be found until a person by the name

of Steinmetz wrote an article called, "Socialism and Invention."31 According to him, the organization of inventors would be taken over by socialist society in place of the industrial enterprise.

In general, he repudiates the idea that withdrawing gain and profit

wiII cause inventors to stop contriving. He concludes by saying:

Thus the great financial rewards awaiting the inventor in present day society are an idle dream. The reward of the inventor is EtarlaLl2KLAILIams, and the satisfaction of his accom lishment.

In Steinmetz's opinion, the motive for invention in socialism is "altruism."

A counter to the "altruism" argument _by_ Steinmetz is the already familiar InztalumAng_DistE721.41itna of Taussig. Taussig

concludes that the inventor's bent is affected immensely by the

prospect of gain, that such an incentive directs **his** activity into

channels of general usefulness, and that, giventhe "economic

structure," inventors are not likely to exert their powers for the public good unless guided, stimulated and rewarded.32 However, it must be emphasized that the "economic structure" teferred to

is **maLallaci;** there is at least one instance of another writer

Implying that Taussig _was_ also referring to "communism. "33

Later in the essays, Tauseig suggests that inventors could be **satisfied** by _some_ other non-economic means:

Many persons, collectivist dreamers and others as well, have imagined systems of honors and decorationswhich should incite men to public achievement.

He cites feudal titles and honorary degrees as examples but then

goes on to say:

would not undertake to say how far a similar method would be feasible in a strictly industrial sphere . . Suffice it to point out that here

Is at least a problem for the ardent social reformer.

He finishes by saying:

Who can say whether anything comparable in effectiveness on the great mass of mankind could

be devised under a different organization of society?

It is quite clear that Taussig was still open to the idea that perhaps there was another way to reward inventive genius besides profit.

From this discussion, there seem to be at least two ideas

which are mentioned by most of the writers In reference to socialism and invention. The first is the importance of the close connection of science, technology and invention, to industry. The second is that inventions would be used collectively by society for its progress. It is interesting to note that the economic and scientific organizations in Tsarist Russia came to the same conclusion. That the above two principles could have had an effect on the thinking of the Bolsheviks when they considered the subject of patent law is open to debate. But since they were there and the Bolsheviks, as Marxists, might have considered them, there is the possibility. In addition, the new rulers were faced with the irksome task of reversing the previous dismal showing of Russian patent experience. An alternative to the existing patent law seemed to be suggested. Let us now turn to the Decree of 1919 to see how the Soviet Union contronted this problem.

II . THE FIRST SOVIET DECREE ON PATENT LAW 1919-1924

The formative years of the new Bolshevik republic could only be described as "hekic." They were finally able to get out of World War I but only at the expense of the humiliating treaty of Brest-Litovsk. As if that were not enough, the country was torn apart by a terrible new war of two fronts, one civil, the other amounting to an external invasion. It was not until the conclusion of the fighting with Poland in 1920 that the drums of war died down to a low rumble.

In general, the economic period from 1917 to 1921 also followed a chaotic course.34 Nationalization and War Communism were frequently dominated by both Allied intervention and civil war, Faced with a continually deteriorating situation, the Bolsheviks tried desperately to mesh ideology with the practical needs of the time. With no "marxist" blueprint to go by, remedies were often found through empirical "trial and error" with all its attendant inefficiency. Matters of state soon degenerated into a case of political survival.

The early measures of 1918-1919 were directed at national­izing various parts of the economy. First to go were the banks, railways and merchant fleet. However, after the initial moves in that direction, only individual industries rather than whole sectors of the economy were selected for the process. The re­gulatory machinery over this network of nationalized industries was called the Supreme Council of the National Economy, better known by its Russian initials, VSNKh. Its job was to organize

-22-

both the national economy and state finance. However, its task

+0,

proved extremely difficultAfulfill.

As the Russians fell deeper and deeper into civil war, the economic problems became more and more impossible to solve. Railways were disrupted, bridges were blown, stores were destroyed. Lack of transportation and communication compounded the already critical situation in food distribution and health care. Society was rapidly being drawn into an economic nightmare:.

The final slide into the grim period known as War Communism was precipitated by severe food shortages in the urban centers.

To get grain for the starving factory workers, the government sent armed agents into the countryside to requisttion it, using brute force when necessary. These odious compulsory deliveries were known as prodrazverstka. As expected, trouble soon arose as the peasants resisted this expropriation of their harvest. A battle raged in full force between the Bolsheviks and the "petty-bourgeois" peasants. In an attempt to weaken their strength, the government tried to fan class warfare in the village, giving rise to a new enemy of the Bolsheviks, the "kuIak.° But the prodrazverstka and the related measures merely caused agricultural production to fall, as the peasants, both kulak and otherwise, simply refused to till the fields. Urban workers started to desert the starving towns for the countryside in order to obtain food,

By late 1919, Russia **was** facing both political and economic strangulation. The rouble collapsed, the government ran out of credit. For a iNhile, the Bolsheviks toyed with the idea of running on a moneyless economy. Workers were paid in kind, many public facilities were free. However, most urban dwellers left the cities

when faced with eventual starvation, resulting in a sharp drop

in industrial production. Transportation was grinding to a deaden­ing halt; bottlenecks in various industries signaled a general economic **crisis.** In early 1920, the Council of Labor and Defense (STO) was created as the heir apparent to a badly sagging VSNKh.

By 1920, Russia was physically and economically exhausted. Although most heavy industrial areas were back in the hands of the Bolsheviks, they were in a severely dilapidated condition. It was becoming clear that the policies of War Communism could

not deal with the growing economic snarl, since the strong measures only brought forth renewed peasant riots. Finally, events such as the Kronstadt rebellion forced the reluctant government in 1921 to beat a strategic retreat to the New Economic Policy.

The situation proved to be no less troublesome In patent law. As with most other matters of state, the Bolsheviks were very inexperienced in the area of patent law. Beforpthem was the pre­vious Tsarist law of 1896, but it had proved to be the "happy hunting ground" of foreign, not...Russian, inventors. They had a few thoughts by Marx and other socialists on invention and socialism, as mentioned in the previous chapter, but no concrete ideas on how to put a patent law together in a socialist society.

It is there—fore not surprising that in July of 1919, the Government of the Revolution decreed that all existing monopoly privileges and rights In inventions for limited terms were annulled as ideologicaIlz inconsistent with the Bolshevist policy of nationalizai, tion. It is as if they tried to solve the problem they did not understand by doing away with it entirely.

The discussion of the law of 1919 and its history **will** be

based for the most part on an excellent paper presented to a British patent society.35 The Law of 1919 is sometimes called the first patent law of the Soviet Union, although aLl it seemed to do was abolish all patent rights in the new republic. There is some confusion on this point, as various sources maintain that patents were continued after 1919. But the majority of explanations that deal with the 1919 Decree suggest that formal protective documents for inventions were done away with until 1924.

Two likely guiding forces behind the Bolshevik move are Indicated. The policy of nationalization of industry is certainly evident as the decree gave to the government Inventions Committee the r1 .ht to declare all inventions reco nizel as usd:Yul to be exolubive property of the State. Another probable reason was that most patented inventions in Russia (about 77%) were formerly awned by foreign inventors. By doing away with patents entirely, they were able to utilize these: inventions without having to compensate the large number of foreign patent holders.

Working the law of 1919 was a difficult and often futile task. The decree, curiously, still recognized and retained the obligation of the inventor to invent for the State and the general public while at the same time the State and the general public had an obligation to reward the inventor. With such an ambiguous relation between the inventor and the State, the system was soon to prove impossible; 36

BY 1920, the practical experience of the Inventions Committee on the working of the recree of 1919 was sufficient to include in their routine half-yearly report issued at the beginning of 1921 a sufficient number of actual cases which pointed

-25-

to the necessity for careful revision and re­consideration of the rights of inventors and their relations to the Government and third parties.

By January, 1920, the system used by the French for registra­tion of Inventions was adopted but it proved totally inadequate

for defining novelty, as well as filling the needs of the situation. In early 1921, the Invention Committee argued for adoption of a more Western style patent system which was in keeping with the Bolshevik tendency during the time to be more concerned with survival of the State than with the ideological considerations of Marx. Apparently)the government **was** very agreeable to such

an argument as VSNKh, together with the State departments, appointed the first Patents Committee in June, 1921 to deal with the problem and make suggestions. The Committee held many sessions, compiled many pages of material, but it was continually hampered by the Decree of 1919 as there was now no legal "property right" to relate to patents. The above situation changed with the decrees of July, 1921 which began the NEP but that is another story.

What about the poor Russian inventor? To him there remained the honor of authorship and the right to demand from third parties and the State some form of material reward. It was the task of the various State departments to give the Inventions Committee guidelines for the nature and amount of the reward, However, the guiding principles often proved so contradictory that the inventor, State departments and the Inventions Committee did not know what their relationship was to each other. In the absence of any sort of property rights for the inventor, he was faced with a dilemma; his bargaining power was almost nonexistent, but he stilt

was obligated to the State according to the Decree of 1919.

The foreign inventor/s problem was even more complex. All previous contracts with the Tsarist government were null and void and patent treaties could only be validated if discussed with

the Bolsheviks at the conference tabled? But even if the foreign applicants country had such a treaty, it was meaningless because "patents;' in actuality)no longer existed in Russia. In 1921, W. C. Redfield of the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce asked for reestablishment of American patent rights in the USSR:38

No compensation has been made Americans for annulment of their rights, neither is such com­pensation included in the policy of the Soviet Government.

An agreement was finally reached between an American lawyer and the Soviet Patent Department in 1924 whereby the Soviet government would give protection to foreign patents on the same basis as the Soviet States.39 As to how much this was influenced by the upcoming Soviet patent law of 1924 is difficult to say. In addition, Russia was to be represented at the Hague in the international patent conference to be held later in the year:44

As happened with most of the hastily set up institutions during the period of War Communism and nationalization of industry, the first Soviet experience with patent law had seveie problems. The shoestring attempts to work around the Decree of 1919 only served to point out difficulties with respect to patents and in­ventions. The ambiguous and hazy nature of the relationship between the inventor and the State could not be tolerated if the

new Bolshevik republic was to stir up any inventive spirit at all. Nationalization of industry required the creation of an industrial plant, but the nationalization of inventions just about precluded the incentive to invent the necessary machinery.

A second problem came from the direction of the foreign market. In 1921, the USSR made a trade agreement with Great Britain and it appeared that the USSR would no longer remain in economic isolation. To entice foreign commerce, some form of patent protection was needed. But the Decree of 1919 did away with such protection and without it, the hope of having outside help, already slim at that time, would be gone.

The only Soviet attempt to combine "altruism " with invention proved to be a miserable failure. The Decree of 1919 provided no practical working structure to protect and encourage inventive spirit. The Inventor, both Soviet and foreign, were caught in an impossible situation. AS time went on, the unmanageability of the decree became apparent and the cry for a structured patent law was answered with a new decree, the Patent Law of 1924.

III. THE NEP LAW , 1924-1931

In September, 1924, a new law incorporating many of the features of German patent law replaced the Decree of 1919.

have called it the "NEP" law because it is very much flavored by the semi-"free-enterprise" policy that originated in 1921.

The era was characterized by the economic reconstruction of Russian 1ndustry.41

Because of World War I, the civil war in Russla)and the excesses and bunglings of War Communism, the in­dustrial plant of Russia in 1921 was at an all time low. With

the NEP, a liberal policy which allowed small groups of individuals to become their own "entrepreneurs" was permitted. It was not a reversal of the previous policy to nationalize industry but simply the recognition that there was little industry to mono­polize.

Initially, the Bolshevik government was forced into this "free-enterprise" phase by the peasant riots, famines in 1920

a

24. Private trade was

nd 1921 and general industrial difficulties. In early 1921, the pzi2W.t.zaa was replaced by a tax in kind (21121[11120 which was later changed to a money tax by 19 legalized but the government still retained control of major factors in the economy, i. e. banking, foreign trade, large- scale industry, Thus, the NEP was a "mixed" economy of small- scale private industry, alongside large, autonomous state enter­prises called "trusts."

Along with the development of Russian industry from the  
inside, the Bolshevik rulers contemplated help from the outside.

The NEP permitted the granting of foreign concessions as a factor in rebuilding the Soviet economy. The concessions functioned

from 1922-1928 but proved to be not so important. Only 42 concession agreements were concluded of which 31 became operational, mainly in timber industries'42

The 68 concessions still around in 1928 accounted for a minute 0.6% of the total industrial output.

Two other important improvements were made in the economy, the first in transportation. The railways, in an appalling condition by 1921, were raised substantially in quality and quantity. The second involved currency reform as the government attempted to put its financial affairs in order. With measuressuch as these, industrial growth slowly started to gain momentum.

But just as the economy begairv its long climb back to pre­8oviet levels, good harvests in 1922 and 1923 precipitated a new problem, the infamous "scissor crisis." Plagued with inefficiency at the manufacturing and distributing levels, industry was grow­ing at a slower rate than agriculture. The result was a shortage of manufactured goods which forced higher industrial pricesochile relatively plentiful grain lowered agricultural prices, creating a gap known as the "scissors." Rather than buying the high- priced urban goods, the peasants frequently kept their produce to themselves, thus turn g the "crisis" into a vicious cycle. The government had some success later in closing the "scissors" although such crises continued to be a thorn in the side of the NEP economy.

The planning and control of the economy was loosely exercised by VSNKh. Most of the newly formed "trusts" were given relatively independent authority. In early 1921, a new body, GOSPLAN, was

set up for coordination of planning and preparation of the budget. while assisting in implementation of the economic measures. It soon became the rival to VSNICh.

The coexistence of state and private enterprise was an uneasy relationship at best. The NEPmen, the term used to describe the private entrepreneurs, were allowed to operate under license so that they could help fill in the gaps left by the state industries. ItAquite evident also that these rights were to be tolerated only until the state enterprises, the "shadow" partner of private industry, could take over. Then the government would step down hard to liquidate the private holdings, as the NEPmen were "de­finitely not respected as saviours of their country."

43

It is in the context of this "new economic policy" that the patent law of 1924 must be studied. The law itself resembles

44

ordinary patent law. All foreigners have the same rights as

Soviet citizens (Sec. 5). Patents for improvements may be grant­ed to others but could only be worked in agreement with the holder of the patent on the basic invention (Sec. 14). If the invention was in use by some organization or person priOr to patenting, the enterprise or individual concerned was under no legal obli­gation to obtain a license (Sec. 16—right of prior user). Sections 24-27 establish the Inventions Committee, the "Soviet" patent office, and its functions. Sections 27 and after define the rules relating to the grant of a patent.

There are three very important sections in the 1924 Soviet patent law. The first is Section 9 which defines the rights of the patentee:

The holder of a patent has the exclusive right. to work his invention commercially within the territories of S. S. S. R. [foviet Uniog and in particular to manufacture, sell, vend, introduce into use or generally dispose of the invention for commeroial purposes. A patent for a process extends to all products produced by that process.

The second is Section 15 which defines cases where a compulsory license may be issued:

Patents for inventions relating to matters affecting Government defence or of Apecial im­portance to the country may, in the absence of agreement, be assigned compulsory for the use of the Government by means of a special act of the S. T. 0. in each case.

The last is Section 18 which refers to the working of a patent:

The holder of a patent must work the invention within the territory of S. S. S. R. either directly **or** by grant of license(s).

The patentee had to work the patent within five years, otherwise any interested person or party could demand from the Inventions Committee a compulsory license.- Section 20 also provides that

a patent can lapse if not "worked" in accordance with Section 18.

The patent law arose directly out of the Second Patents Committee organized by VSNKh.45 The NE?, as mentioned before, gave the necessary basis for the framing of the patent law along Western lines. Another factor of no small influence was to use the law of 1924 as enticement for foreign investment. The fact that the Soviet Union concluded several bilateral patent treaties during

the 1920's with European powers like Germany and Italy lends validity to this argument.46

How did our Soviet Inventor fae'e.? To be sure, his rights

had substantially improved. Now there was definite protection for the inventor's work. Also, there were no annual taxes needed to keep the patent in force as in pre-Soviet times. However, his monopoly was subject to the monopoly rights granted to state enterprises.47 **His** rights were "conditional" in that as state enterprise continued to shove out the private sector, the inventor's avenues of exp•tpitation would narrow as well. In addition,'the provisions on compulsory license were so vague that the State could pretty much use any excuse to use Section 15. The "work­ing° provision (Sec. 18) could be used, especially where state enterprises dominated, to force the inventor to license his in­vention for a smaller fee. The rights the Soviet inventor gained were substantial, but confined.

There seemed to be some patenting abroad by the Russians at this time. The president of a New York firm of international patent brokers was enpowered to patent a number of Russian inventions

ever, such cases were rare.

The following is a table of patent figures while the 1924 law was in force:49

Applications Patents

|---|---|---|---|
   
|Year|(total)|(total) (domestic)|   |

|1928|13003|2900|2356|
|1929|22195|5288|4273|

Patenting in Russia showed a remarkable increase since the first year of the law. It should also be noted that Russian patents owned by foreign inventors comprised less than 17% of the total, a reversal of the previous trend in Tsarist Russia.

The foreign inventor had much the same problems as that of his Soviet counterpart. With state enterprise taking over more and more of the industrial sphere, his choices became limited although he could possibly use the foreign concession rights mentioned before to expipit his invention in the Soviet Union. But generally **his** right was very restricted which has led one writer to say, "For the foreigner, at least, Di) is a right with no reality."50 And if the foreign inventor came from a country which did not have a bilateral patent treaty with the USSR, his chances of obtaining a patent were even more remote. Reports that Americans were having trouble registering patents and trade­marks due to lack of recognition by the USSR tends to lend some basis to the point, even though officials of the U. S. State Eepartment and Patent Office were to say that such a statement was unfounded.51 While his help was sometimes solicited, it is plain from the patent data that the foreign inventor was not too keen on taking advantage of the opportunity.

The NEP period reached Its high-water mark in 1925. Severe problems with the law of 1924 did not arise until the late 1920's. However, the forming of a country's economy dominated by state enterprise and a patent law based on the individual's right to work the invention as he sees fit were soon to become incompatible, especially with coming of the first Five-Year Plan in 1928. The only buyers of the invention were soon government institutions

and economic bodies. There was an additional difficulty. The party which might be interested was often some bureaucratic in­stitution, preoccupied in reconstructing the industrial plant and far from eager to spend time and money on a "new" invention.52

In short, the law of 1924 was becoming obsolete. The direction of Soviet industry towards vast "supertrusts" was soon to no longer mesh with a "free-enterprise" patent law. As the NP started to ebb, the Soviet authorities came to the conclusion that inven­tion needed to be not only protected but implemented as well. The problem of encouraging inventiveness in a society that vastly differed from the others surrounding it still remained. What was required was a law more in keeping with a socialist economic structure. Such a new experiment was tried in 1931.

.,----, IV. THE FIRST SOCIALIST PATENT LAW, 1931-1941

,,-----\

By the late 192015, the "free-enterprise" phase of Soviet history was fast fading out, The Soviet industrial plant was approaching the highest pre-Soviet levels but was now facing

the problem of "growing pains." While good at helping Soviet in­dustry recover, the NEP proved incapable of expanding it. Economic stagnation had started to set in after 1925.

But what was to be the future path of the Soviet economy? Lenin, dead since 1924, had failed to indicate how long the NEP was to last or what was to be its successor. A plan for correct­ing the lethargic economy proved equally elusive to the remaining 3olsheviks. No one seemed to know in what direction the solution would lie,

The random arguments, proposals, and suggestions over the eventual course of Russian economic life assumed some order in the exciting period of intellectual ferment known as the Great Debate.53 Although several alternative programs to the NEP were offered by various groups, only two came under significant con­sideration,. The first **was** espoused through the "right deviationists" led by Bukharin. Their suggestion amounted to little more than a continuation of the existing NEP.. The better-off peasant must not be antagonized as he would supply the needed farm surpluses for industrialization. Over a period of years, Bukharin felt that the peasant would slowly cast off his "petty-bourgeois" attitude in favor of socialism. Through this mild program, it was hoped that agriculture and industry would be merged into a harmonious

relationship.

The "rightist" policy of gradual economic development faced stiff opposition from the more radical "Ieft deviationists." Bukharin's un-Marxian statement (later retracted) of enrichissez­vous especially provoked their ire. The leading proponent for their program was Preobrazhensky and his philosophy of "primitive cialist accumulation." Industrial growth was to be actively encouraged. To accomplish this objective, the State would have to expand the socialist sector at the expense of the private. Rather than helping the peasant, they would have to squeeze him unmercifully.

Discussion over the two alternative economic policie2 was soon to be no longer divorced from politics. A parallel fight over who was to be the successor to Lenin developed between the factions of the more conservative "right" and radical leaning "left," with Stalin playing the uneasy role of "moderate." Perhaps because of Trotsky's inclination towards the proposals of Preo­brazhensky, Stalin initially allied himself with the right-wing economists and attacked the industrial policy of the "left" as "too extreme." After riding himself of the Trotsky faction, Stalin then turned on his former allies by embracing the econo­mic policies of the previously deposed "left" as the true course

to socialism. Whether by political or economic calculation, Stalin ultimately made the choice to harness Russian society to heavy industrialization by 1928.

To anyone familiar with the Witte "gamble" of the 1890's, the similarities between his policy of railroad building and Stalin's accelerated program for Soviet advancement are quite striking.

-37..

Both squeezed the peasantry to finance industry and strenuouSly involved the government in the economy. Yet the peculiarities of the Soviet situation led to a different approach, often violent and brutal in its technique.

By 1927, the almost defunct VSNKh was rapidly integrated into GOSPLAN, now the primary body for Soviet economic planning.54 From this agency, the first Five-Year plan was formulated in 1928. The effort to provide a reasonable set of goals for the first Plan ran into immediate difficulties. Caution and balance were equally frowned upon and denounced by Stalin, so it was not likely that sound economic .planning would prevail. No doubt the experts in GOSPLAN worked hard at trying to draw up a workable plan, but with the above threat hanging over their heads, they adopted optimistic objectives, to be replaced later by more fantastic targets.

The reorganization of industry in the first Five-Year plan brought with it simultaneous consideration of another problem; agriculture, How to deal with the peasant and the ever present procurement crisis was a perplexing question. Although Stalin and his colleagues were still undecided on total collectivization

of agriculture, they certainly had it mind. One of the provisions in the first Plan was a marked advance in that direction. The traditional distrust and fear of Stalin and the Bolsheviks towards the countryside's "petty-bourgeois" tendencies, the problems of industrial development and the general political atmosphere made the final march to the kolkhoz a much easier choice to make.

If the right-wing economists were displeased with the program of Preobrazhensky, they undoubtedly gnashed their teeth over the

more radical version submitted by Stalin. But their total defeat

by 1929 dealt a fatal blow to the last source of opposition to the Stalinist plan.

The sudden move to intensive collectivization was started

in mid-1929.55 It was aimed both at destroying the so-called

"kulak" class and forcing the peasants to sell their grain, even

at low prices, to the government. But as Stalin pressed for faster collectivization, the reluctant peasant became ever more resistant, even when under the constant threat of inclusion as an agent of the "kulaks" if he did not "toe-the-line." However, by early 1930,

half of the rural population was in under this vast, often coercive process, until the stiff peasant reaction against it forced even the tough-skinned Stalin to call a halt, much to the increased confusion and embarrassment of his officials.

Gradually, the offense was resumed again, as more peasants were drawn into the kolkhoz. Some peasants fled to the towns

as a result. Government control over the village was strengthened further through a compulsory service agency, the Machine Tractor Station (MPS) which provided both machine power and political- economic guidance.

The degrading effect of rapid collectivization soon came

home to haunt the countryside. By 1932-3, poor harvests and a demoralized peasant forced a crisis in agriculture. In 1933, there

was terrible famine, conditions were growing steadily worse. While

supposedly laying the base for industry, the collectives proved inefficient and incapable for the assigned task. Such borderline situations of subsistence or starvation were to become a grim

characteristic of future Soviet agriculture.

Even though agriculture **was** failing to hold its own, the push for heavy industrialization became an unrealistic dream- world of "optimism run riot."56 In part, the Soviets were in­fluenced in their move by increasingly important military-stra­tegic considerations. But most of their plans went far beyond the realm of possibility. Consumption, both in the city as well as the countryside, was drastically curtailed to increase the output of capital goods. Certain badIy-needed industries, such

as textiles and railroads, became low priority items in the squeeze to stimulate the "heavy" sectors of the economy.

The result for both the peasant and the worker was an abysirnat­ly low standard of living. Housing facilities were greatly over­taxed. Increasing inflationary pressure because of the small num­ber of consumer goods forced a worsening of trade terms. What goods were available were exorbitatly priced above cost, another means by which the government forced reduced private consumption. Finally, what little money was left to the worker after purchasing basic necessities was often taken away through coerced sale of state bonds used to finance the growth of heavy industry.

With the advent of the second Five-Year plan, the previously confused, unrealistic and often disastrous program returned to a slightly more sober couret' The first Plan had attempted to do too, much, too fast. The excesses in industrial policy and planning and the hideous effects of initial collectivization are painful examples of the crude and brutal administrative methods used to achieve the economic objectives. The modest slogan of the new Plan was "consolidation." The peasants were now almost totally collectivized; agriculture began its long climb from the abyss

of 1932-3. A struggling heavy industrial plant had been started

In Soviet Russia at great sacrifice. Although plagued by an econo­mic slowdown **in** 1937 and the political terror of the Great Purge where many of the experts in economic and military planning were "removed" or reduced to rubber-stamp status, the years after 1933 became a period of saner, less haphazard improvement in the Soviet economy.

Parallel to the change in the direction of Russian industrial and agricultural development was the new phase in Soviet patent law formulated in the Decree of April 9, 1931. The law itself contained 106 sections divided into ten major parts. The tone and direction of the law was set very much by the preamble:57

  

Mass inventions constitute one of the most Important forms of immediate participation of the workers in socialist rationalization of production and in the introduction of new technique into the national economy of the USSR .

The patent legislation which has existed until

now and has protected the interest of the inventor by granting him an exclusive right to his invention no Ion er satisfies the as irations of the foremost Inventors.

It has become necessary to create other forms of interrelation between the worker-inventor and the socialist state, which will be in keeping with the role of the worker-inventor as an immediate participant in socialist construction .

**Irlawi l•40****.****1**..11.1.04.1.71.1.4.1.1*.••••• •••••1*.nRF

It is quite clear that the emphasis of Soviet patent legislation was to be invention linked to industry.

Part I lays out the general provisions of the new law.58 A new form of protection called an "inventor's certificate" or "certificate of authorship" is established (Sec. 4). It gives the State the right of sole exploitive use of the Invention in

-41-

exchange for various benefits given to the inventor. In addition, the inventor or his heir, if they were artisans, could use the invention in their own enterprise. The further ramifications of this new type of protection for inventions will be discussed later.

The rights of the patent are defined in Section **5.** **No one,** not even the State, had the right to use the invention without the permission of the owner. The owner of the patent could operate

the invention in accordance with laws concernins_private enterprlse,, an extremely vague term. However, the rights of the patentee were restricted by the "right of the prior user," the obligation to work the invention in the USSR within three years and if the invention was deemed of at Importance to the State, but no agreement could be reached with the inventor, the Inventions Committee had the right to annul the patent or allow the patent

1,2_121_11E21_12LI-ELeUfted FPYPEP-m91_111-1.°/., with some sort

of compensation to be given to the inventor. Other provisions were that no patents but only certificates of authorship were to be issued for work in anyway connected or supported by an insti­tution of the government. Protection was to be given to "tech­nical improvements," a nebulous term for ideas not considered inventions (Sec. 10). In addition, foreigners were to enjoy equal footing with Soviet citizens (Sec. 11).

Part II is concerned with those institutions working with inventions. The equivalent of "patent office" was the Inventions Committee of the Council of Labor and Defense (Sec. 5). The formation of separate inventions bureaus in each republic and industrial enterprise under the Inventions Committee is set up under Section 14. In Section 15, the various tasks of the

(republic) offices formed in Section 14 are stated: (1) select useful inventions; (2) organize the exchange of inventions be­tween enterprises of a given branch; (3) link new inventions to the plans of industry; (4) mdfolinttn:Ln21,221_2liter **aLam_La_222211219**._use in a iven branch office; (5) generally guide inventors and the lower offices. The one underlined task probably refers to possible "piracy" of foreign technology. Section 16 gives a similar set of tasks to the invention offices in the various enterprises g (1) assist in technical working out of inventions and improvements; (2) function as "patent agent" for inventors; (3) take measures to promote invention; (4) uti­lize valuable inventions fully; (5) inform higher offices of the enterprise about the utilization of inventions and improvembntt.

Part III is concerned specifically with the selection and utilization of inventions and technical improvements and specifies how the invention offices are to go about doing it.

Part IV defines the procedure for the application and veri­fication of inventions where a certificate of authorship is re­quested. Only the inventor or his heir can request it and if requested, the factory, institution or invention office must apply for it (Sec. 38). All applications are to be filed with the Inventions Bureau of the Inventions Committee of the Council of Labor and Defense (Sec. 39).

Part V deals with the rules for granting patents. They generally are the same as those for a certificate of authorship (Sec, 58). One notable exception is Section 60 which says that foreign applicants must enpawer someone in the USSR to act as "patent agent." The Inventions Committee decides, however, who

may act in that capacity. Another is the taxes on a patent Including application and (quite heavy) annual renewal taxes; failure to pay them voids the patent.

Part VII concerns itself with secret inventions and improve­ments. Section 78 states:

Inventions and improvements appertaining to

the defence of the country are considered confi­dential (secret.).

In addition, at the request of an interested institution or branch office or by its own initiative, the Inventions Committee may declare an invention or improvement secret in the interest of the State.

Part TX is on the patenting or realizing of inventions

abroad. All inventions patented in the USSR can be patented abroad only with the permission of the Inventions Committee (Sec. 85). As far as protection of rights abroad, certificates

of authorship are placed ln_IILI same category as patents (Sec. 86).

Part X was of real interest to the inventor as it laid out the remuneration and privileges to be given to him in exchange for a certificate of authorship. The responsibility and methods

for compensating the "certificate" holder are stated in various

sections **(1. e.** Secs. 87 & 90). Of particular delight to the inventor were Sections 95-106 which specified the privileges and rewards to be given, such as housing, better jobs, etc.

There were several motivating factors which shaped the law of 1931. One was the first Five-Year plan which,according to Olkhovskychanged the psychology of the Soviet inventor:59

For a better understanding of the changing psychology of Soviet inventors, it must be stated that they saw in the fulfillment of this grandiose plan the rebirth of the Nation, based on a new economic system with eventual radical changes for the betterment of the standard of living of the entire population.

As to whether the .Soviet inventor say a "grandiose plan" is highly questionable, but that the planners of the Soviet patent law took into consideration "new" inventions needed to fulfill the Five- Year plan certainly cannot be denied.

The second is the failure of the 1924 law to deal with an economic system heading towards state enterprise and "supertrusts" and the need to have a law oriented in such a direction. That this was plain to the Soviets is indicated in an order issued in October, 1930 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party.6o It called attention to the fact that utilization of inventions, improvements and the like was unsatisfactory. A reason given was underestimation of the importance of inventions and they thus called for a new patent law to replace the old one which would assure stimulation of inventive spirit.

A third reason which is often not mentioned but of consider­able importance is not only the influence of Stalin, but also his policy of essentially "autarkic" economic development. It is implied by the patent law of 1931 that the major source of inventions for Soviet industrial application were to come almost solely from the Soviet inventor. As a result, the problem of protection for the foreign inventor is mentioned only in pass­ing under the statute of 1931.

An illustration of this new direction and dimension in patent

law is the unique form of protection known as the certificate of authorship to be ften referred to simply as ncertif1cate.11 The certificate originated under the 1931 law and gave the exploitive right of the invention to the State. There was no counterpart to it in any other patent law at that tine. It was very much in keeping with the character of Soviet invention as stated in the preamble. Some Western authors have considered It to be a system of employee bonuses rather than actual protection of invention. That this was to be the main form of protection in the Soviet Union is verified by the fact that 991 of the Soviet inventors during the period 1931-1941 took out certificates.

The history of Soviet patent law from 1931-1941 has only two other decrees of importance. The Decree of October 31, 1931 set up a table of calculations for determining the financial reward to be given to certificate holders as specified in the Decree of April, 1931. By the Decree of July 22, 1936 of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars, the Inventions Committee was dissolved.61 Each government commissariat or department (there were 17) was to assume direct control of the Issuance of certificates of authorship and patents as related to their domain. The State Planning Commission (GOSPLAN) was to maintain a central register for deposit of such Issuances, cor­relate them and guard aginst duplication. In the case of con­troversy, the Committee for Soviet Control, a body of substantial authority, was to insure that important inventions and improve­ments were utilized. Reasons given for the decree are the gener­a! breakdown of the branch office system under the Inventions Committee and possible alignment of the patent structure

with the new Soviet constitution of 1936. In any case, the entire system became quite centralized as the powers of the separate patent office, the Inventions Committee, were taken away and given to the individual commissariats, making control from the top much easier.

There are a number of statistics known about the period 1931-1941. The following is a list of applications filed:62

This list can be compared with the number of patents (excluding those to foreign applicants) issued per year (average) during the same period in other countries: in Great Britain, 6675; in the

64

u. si„ 14,947; and in Germany, 38,413. It is suggested that

I-N the drop in issuances, especially evident after 1936, was due to:

(1) stricter examination for novelty; and (2) fear by the Soviet government of impending war which led to tighter control on publication of technical matters related to national defense.65 Even then,

think it is clear that the patent as a form of protection in the Soviet Union was decreasing in importance to the certificate of authorship.

Discussion of how the law of 1931 was arranged for the in­ventor in the USSR tells much of the story of the decline of the patent. The certificate of authorship was very attractive to the Soviet inventor because it gave him, in exchange for delegating the invention to the State, a reward both in monetary form and

in privileges at no cost to himself. But if he took out a patent, he was barred by law from demanding the privileges and remuneration afforded by the certificate, even on later certificates issued in his name. Thus the Soviet patentee's means for getting reward was through license of his invention. But, with private enterprise just about nil, the only true market was the Soviet government. With the threat of compulsory license at hand and the heavy annual taxes levied on a patent, his bargaining position was extremely poor. So rather than go through the bother of obtaining a patent, the Soviet inventor could forgo much time and effort by getting a certificate. In addition, to obtain necessary backing to work on an invention, the Soviet inventor just about had to use a government institution which negated any chance to apply for a patent.

The following statement pretty well sums up the situation for the foreign inventor:66

The legislation CO31 Soviet patent lalp

is of a purely domestic interest and does nothing to _assist,_ but rather seems designed to deter the foreigner.

The certificate of authorship was unattractive because the re­muneration and privileges it offered were of little use outside the Soviet Union. The foreign inventor could always apply for

a patent and most of them did, but in view of the restrictive re­gulations mentioned before, the protection was of little value.

If, however, a foreign inventor wanted to market a product in the USSR, the patent could possibly help him: (1) bar Soviet interests from using the invention without his consent; and (2) come to some sort of licensing agreement.67 Even when such limited protection was degrable, he faced an additional obstacle whenever he patented his invention in a country that did not have a re­ciprocity patent agreement with the Soviet Union. His application In the USSR could be (and frequently was) "anticipated" (rendered unpatentable) by the previously issued patent! Yet the failure to patent his invention in the USSR, especial/y if the foreigner's country didkot have the above "reciprocity" in patent law with the USSR, often meant the foreign inventor would lose the right to his invention in the USSR. The USSR was not under an inter­national patent agreement and was under no pressure to respect the "sovereignty" of his invention.

Statistical information on foreign patenting in the Soviet Union In the period 1931-1941 is sketchy. Up to 1933, apparently Less than 5% of all the applications were by foreigners (less than 2% in the mentioned year).68 "Of the foreign applications

In 1933, 105 were by Germans and 35 by Americans; less than 155 patents were issued to American inventors, 1931-1934.69 Even

this fragmentary data, along with the general structure and Intent of the 1931 law, suggest that (1) the total number of foreign applications in the Soviet Union was very small; (2) the limited number of issued patents (less than 2% of the total issues, 1938-1940) were granted almost exclusively to foreign inventors; and (3) **in** view of (2) and the general nature of the certificate of authorship, he took out very few certificates for protection of his invention.

While the foreign inventor **was** having a very difficult time of it, his Soviet counterpart, in spite of the restrictions, was having much more success.70

Certainly the rise of the Stakhanov movement **with its** incentives to labor had something to do with his rise in stature. A society for inventors, the All-Union Society of Inventors, was organized in the early 1930s and in­cluded not only inventors but those who were active in some way in the field. The number of members rose from 500,000 in 1931

to 800,000 by 1935. It was organized to help correlate inventive activity, contact other inventors, and give them aid in over­coming obstacles. In May, 1934, the USSR issued a decree requiring local Soviets to actively assist this society of inventors. Rivalry and competition were encouraged; invention was made a state activity,71 At the 17th Congress of the Communist Party, Stalin himself spoke of the important position of the inventor; systematic invention became widespread as schools for the in­genious were established.72 The position of the Soviet inventor had improved significantly since 1919.

The Decree of April, 1931 is often called the first "socialist" patent law. I have dealt with it in some length because of its importance as a new course for the protection of inventive spir­it and because of its influence on later Soviet patent law. However, this "new" course had many noticeable difficulties. Before 1936, the system in general failed to live up to expecta­tions.73 The rewards to inventors often were not forthcoming, they encountered trouble In getting their inventions approved, the improvements were slow to be implemented and there was a general failure of the factories to use the new procedures for utilization of inventions. The work of the Invention offices proved incompatible with industry; most were soon abolished Another problem not often brought out is the hesistancy of manage­ment to implement new inventions because of the Decree of December, 1934 which made themaElminaila_mlEmE11212. for production of defective goods or for failure of the factory to meet quotas. The managers often found themselves caught between the Decree of 1931 and the Decree of 1934.

The Decree of 1936 alleviated some of these problems, but for the most part they were left unsolved. How to carry out the provisions of the 1931 patent law remained a troublesome thorn. The terms were frequently ill-defined, the procedures for imple­menting it were just about nonexistent and the managers, who would be most affected by the new inventions, were faced with an im­possible dilemma. Clearly, there was still much to be done before theory could be joined to practice in a working relationship. The next attempt by the Soviets to remedy the situation was the patent law of 1941.

V. THE CLAIN FOR INVENTION , 1941-1959

The late 1940's were a retread of the late 1920's and 1930's. After initial recovery from the devastating losses inflicted

by World War 11 on the countryside and industrial plant, Stalinist industrialization proceeded with renewed force and vigor. Once more, agriculture was yoked to the plow of heavy industry. Consumer goods production remained a low priority item.

Stalin's death in 1953 brought a huge sigh of relief to the severely strained Russian economy. While still stressing the importance of industrializing the Soviet Union at a more than moderate pace, the economic policies of Malenkov and, later, of Khrushchev improved the previously destitute condition of both the peasant and the worker. Consumer industries were encouraged, the problems of agriculture received more attention. The result was a substantial uplifting of the Soviet standard of living.

But the late 1950's and early 1960's were to see Khrushchev squander much of the new prosperity on extravagant measures to further rectify and improve the economy. dis agricultural policy created confusion and disorder among the peasantry, resulting indirectly in the poor harvests of the late 1950's through early 1960's. Expenditures on costly military and space projects forced resources away from vitally needed sectors of the economy. The search for **n**expendient" methods to correct the previous abuses merely brought on one crash program after another. A shrewd and capable politician iihrushchev was; an economic planner and ad­ministrator he certainly was not.

**-52-**

By the early 1960Is, he had placed _his_ head under an economic and political "sword of Damocles." The Virgin Lands Program, his final attempt to gain success in agriculture, was a dismal failure. The "sword" finally fell in 1964 as an indignant party leadership ousted Khrushchev from power, in part over his economic policies. With his removal, economic planning returned to a less dramatic but more reasonable and constructive line of development.

Like the Soviet economy, Soviet patent law did not show much sign of change until the Khrushchev era. The 1940's and 1950Is were to see very little done to help the practical advancement of socialist patent law. The law of 1941 and the following regulation of 1942 were generally "colorless" compared to the law of 1931. A world war and "cold" war were to see that, for the most part, it was "All Quiet On the Russian Patent Front." The cry of technological "priacy" by East and West and the laughable attempt by the Russians to claim everything from the wheel to the airplane provided the only comic relief in a generally dull time

On March 5, 1941, a "Statute Concerning Inventions and Technical Improvements" was enacted, later to be modified by the Regulation of November 27, 1942 which established tables and

75

procedures for rewarding inventors. It was very similar to the

Decree of 1931 as modified by the Decree of 1936. There was the certificate of authorship (Sec. 3), the compulsory licensoand

the right of the prior user (Sec. 4). Section514 and 15 established that the Constituent Republics and central managements of the cooperative organizations were to serve the collective, issuing and managing function)as in the Decree of 1936. Secret inventions

-

For the first time, inventions and technical improvements were

53-

were covered by Title V, patenting and utilization of inventions abroad by Title VI and rewards to inventors having certificate5 by Title VII, For most of its basic provisions, the law of 1941 was an exact copy of the law of 1931.

There were some notable differences. One was Section 2 which defined how issuability was to be determined;

An author's certificate or patent shall be issued only for such inventions as may be utilized ln_indlastry.

Another was Section 4 which defined the rights of a patent:

No one may, without the consent of the owner of the patent, use the invention; the per­son to whom the patent belongs may issue permits (licenses) for the use of his invention to any organization or individual.

There were tougher provisions on divulging the essence of an invention before application (Sec. 12). Section 22 emphasized more strongly than the 1931 law that engineering, technical and executive people could receive reward for development, construction and application of inventions and technical improvements. Of substahtial interest was Section 29 which said

Each application filed with the People's Commissariat shall be examined for the purpose of ascertainment of the Presence of indicia of substantial novelty and usefulness,

to be examined not only for "newness" (novelty) but also for their "application" (utility). Of interest to the foreign inventor was Section 44 which designated the All-Union Chamber of Commerce to serve as his "patent agent."

Another difference came out in the Regulation of 1942.

Section 2 mentioned a new form of protection called a "rationaliza­tion proposal:"

Suggestions, for rationalization to which the present order extends are suggestions of a pro­ductive-technical character which directly improve the productive process by means of more effective utilization of equipment, material or workers,

but which do not essentially change the construction or technological process of the industry.

This form of protection did not extend to improvements of or­ganization or administration of the national economy.

The motives and forces behind the law, such as increased incentive for the inventor) are evident from its contents. The influence of the 1931 law is very obvious. Possibly the need to relieve the ambiguous situation of management personnel so

as to encourage them to implement new inventions was the driving force behind Section 22. And most of all, the discouragement of the patent in favor of the certificate of authorship continued.

As mentioned before, the historical developments in Soviet patent law were few and far between until the late 1950's.

World War 11 and the following polarization of the former Allies certainly slowed things down. One particular incident was over accusations from Molotov that the U. S. and Great Britain were taking reparations, including 200,000 German patents.76 Both

the U. S. and Great Britain refuted the charge. Secretary Marshall denied that the U. S. had "looted" German patents.77 Foreign Secretary Bevin of Great Britain and Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the British Board of Tradeoiso rebuffed the Soviet claim that the British or Americans were "hoarding" or obtaining exclusive benefit from German patents>as reports on such material were available to all Allied officials.78 Said Cripps:

the Russians benefit from it just as much as we do and this is made clear by the fact that the Russians have been the best and most consistent purchasers of the reports on German production methods.

The challenge was hurled back to the Soviet Union when William 0. Foster, Under-secretary of Commerce)testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that the U. S. had made available German industrial secrets to the world whilethe USSR had failed to do so."

Included among these Often ridiculous squabbles was the incredible claim by J. Parnell Thomas, ChaArman of the Congressional Committee on Un-American Activities,that'the Soviets were "steal­ing" vital military secrets, including processes related to the atomic bomb, via the U. S. Patent Office:80

Recently, it came to my notice and that of the Un-American Activities Committee of the House, of which I am chairman, that the Soviet Union, since 1943, acting through her agencies in the United States, has succeeded in obtaining practically every industrial, chemical, and military patent from our Patent Office—hundreds of thousands of them—dealing with every phase of our technological development. .

Russia obtained these patents, for example, by having one of their front agencies in the United States flood the Patent Office with orders

for patents. . • [on] agency--known as

the Four Continent Book Corperation, **41 41**

**is** described on its letterhead as being importers from the USSR of new, old, and rare books.

Other patents were obtained by having the

Amtorg Trading Corporation of New York, . a

place orders for thousands of patents in every

field. e • 8

But what other course may we pursue, when imperialistic rfl conspirators persist upon this earth? . • . I see no other course than to impound all patents pertaining, even remotely, to the atomic bomb until the world Is completely stabilized, and if we play ball with Russia, wetve got to see to it that Russia plays ball *-ith us.

The last paragraph is absurd when one considers that the U. S. Patent Office was (antistill is) required by law to; (1) hold confidential all Inventions related to "military secrets': by not Issuing a patent until the invention is later declassified; and (2) sell copies of any issued patent to all interested parties, be they foreign or otherwise.

As if there were not already enough ridiculous claims and counterclaims, in the late 1940's and early 1950T5' the Russians said that just about every invention of importance had been dis­covered by some, often obscure, "Russian" inventor. These claims often referred back to Tsarist times. The Yugoslavians became so enraged over one particular incident concerning a Croatian national that they accused the Soviets of "willfully falsifying cIaims."B As the list of "Russian" inventions became ever long­er, one reader of the New York Times added further humor by sub­mitting the already mentioned passage out Turgenev's novel _(see_ page 14).

There was not much else, outside of an occasional "claim"

or the cry of technologicaliracy," until 1956 when the Committee

for Inventions and Discoveries was set up to take over the func­tion of "patent office." This move probably reflected the trend towards decentralization and de-Stalinization.

Then a most notable development occurred which hinted at a new course in Soviet patent policy. In 1959, Rand Development Corp., a patent holding company, set up offices in Moscow to study Soviet technological advances with the object of securing patent rights and licenses.82 They received considerable encourage­ment from the Russians; however, the office was later closed after the strained relations resulting from the U-2 incident of the early 1960's.

The figures on patenting in the Soviet Union are very scattered until 1955 where data taken from a monthly average of 210 cer­tificates gives a total of about 2520.83 The following list takes it up to 1959

Both certificates and patents were increasing in volume although the former's Superiority (over 99% of the total) is quite evident. Also there should be noted the high rejection rate; less than

25% of the applications were successful. Aitthough it is difficult to say what this "high" rejection rate reflects, there are some _Likely possibilities. One Is the severity of the Soviet examination

procedure; some applications were rejected for extremely arbi­trary reasons. Another was that, of the vast flood of applications that reached the examining bodies, most were so poorly researched that duplication of effort or of previously patented inventions became probable. A final reason that was not articulated publicly until after 1959 was that if an invention was not likely to be used in the immediate or near future, protection for it frequently was. denied.

The discussion of the 'Soviet inventor's role during the 1950's comes from "The Coordinated Soviet Effort to Promote and Apply hajor Inventions."85

The Communist Party and Soviet labor union leaders, at this time, stressed the importance of invention as a means by which persons might participate in technological advancement. In a resolution adopted on October 19, 1956 by the All-Union Conference of Inventors, Production Innovators, and Suggestors of Ways to Increase Efficiency, there was the emphasis upon the members to aid in the advancement. What they hoped to achieve is expressed in the laSt sentence of the resolution:

86

The acceleration of technical proRTess will

guarantee a new, major increase in labour pro‑

ductivity, • which, as the great Lenin taught,

constitutes in the final analysis the most im‑

portant and principal factor in the victory of

the new social order, in the victory of communism.

As typical of the spirit of Soviet inventive effort, everything was to be organized, little was left to individualism; in the

is

same resolution, thismade abundantly clear.

Apparently the top party leadership gave considerable thought

-59-

87

to new technology; such influence was strengthened under Khrushchev. Multitudes of scientific committees were organized. The basic Soviet policy on science and technology came from the Presidium of the Central Committee as at least half the members had some technological background. It was from these bodies that the Soviet inventor received aid and guidance.

That the Soviet inventor was pretty much directed in his efforts is shown plainly by the fact that from 1946-1956, only one patent was granted to a Soviet citizen and only five more were granted to Soviet inventors between 1956 and 1959, as in­dicated by the following table!

88

Year Issues Patents

The preferred status of the certificate of authorship had almost done in the patent as a form of protection for the Soviet inventor. The linking of Soviet invention to Soviet industry was just about complete.

However, the sheltered life of the Soviet inventor was making him a poor competitor with the rest of the world. The Eighth Soviet Chemical Congress expressed fears of non-Soviet "pirating" of Russian inventions,89

Such fears seemed to indicate the lack of knowledge by Soviet inventors on patent protection. In a system where the certificate of authorship was the usual course of action, such ignorance is not surprising. From 1931-1960, less than ten books on how to obtain protection for an invention

were published in the USSR, none of them on procedures for patent application abroad ,90

, That the Soviet Union had a woeful track record in patenting outside the USSR is supported by the statistics. For the period 19404946, about 20 U. S. patents were issued to Soviet inventors.91 The following table gives a list of patent applications filed by Russians in other countries, 1957-1959 (numbers in parentheses indicate patent grants):92

Whether by Soviet design or malfunction, socialist invention was strictly a "domestic" commodity.

The foreign inventor, as in 1931-1941, was both neglected

and discouraged. With the USSR still not part of the international patent convention, his status in the Soviet Union was very un­certain. In the middle 1940's, the U. S. State Department sought to make some sort of agreement where the USSR would give greater recognition to American patents.93 Such a move was pushed by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM))who said that American inventors were not protected, thus American industry was reluctant to give technological developments to the USSR. Another point brought was the general ignorance of Americans about Soviet patent law; a member of the National Inventors Council had to inform NAP that there **was,** indeed, such a thing as a Soviet patent.

Between 1946 and 1956, 442 patents were granted to foreigners.

The following table gives the totals for foreign patent involvement

Foreign applications and issuances (including certificates) amounted to a meager 0.8% and 2% of the totalrrespectively, although what few applications were filed had reasonable success (49%). Matters were not helped by the fact that the USSR Chamber of Commerce as patent agent proved very unsatisfactory to foreign­ers. It can be safely said that the foreign inventor did not care much for Soviet patent law up to 1959.

The Soviet law of 1941 went glightly further than the law of 1931 to clear up ambiguous situations but it still failed to solve a number of nagging problems. The general lack of knowledge of how to get patent protection abroad was hurting Soviet efforts to market their inventions anywhere but at home. Soviet law was always weak in that area. But perhaps the greatest problem was the bureaucratic "red" tape that confronted the frustrated Soviet inventor. There were a number of examples. The most embarrassing illustration comes from the Russian novel, Iii2Lay._ead Alone, by Vladimir rudintsev.95 The apparent furor caused over it has tended to make the story a "true" description of the times. The hero, a teacher-inventor called Lopatkin, invents, on his own, a machine which could be of vital importance to Soviet industry. While blocked in his efforts to get the

invention accepted, other members of the bureaucracy attempt to steal it or sidetrack it. Eventually, the hero winds up in a labor camp for supposedly divulging an invention (his own) im­portant to the defense of the USSR.

Two less "dramatic" examples come from real life. In 1956, A. F. Garmashev complained of the urwrrating of inventions, non-payment to inventors and slowness of implementation of in­ventions into the Soviet economy.96 Among other things, the Plenum of the Central Committee adopted the following resolution on June 29, 1959:97

At the same time it must be admitted that

in the practice of our economic buildup the prin­ciple of material stimulus is still insufficient­ly used. . . . Not infrequently, workers in enterprises in the process of mastering new tech‑

,— nology find themselves worse off regarding payment for their work than the workers of enterprises producing by out-dated methods.

Clearly, Soviet patent "theory" and Soviet patent "practice" were not coming together.

The Inefficiency of the Soviet patent system was becoming obvious to the Soviets. The general propaganda in the late forties and early fifties suggest that the Soviet Union could

do little more than extoll the virtues of "Russian" inventiveness. In 1957, the USSR and China purchased nearly 800,000 copies of

a wide range of patents from the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh for what was thought to be part of an effort to improve their scientific and technical libraries,98 This also suggests that while sounding forth the greatness of the Soviet Inventor, the USSR was less than satisfied with his performance. In addition,

-63-

foreign corporations, like Rand, were unlikely to have continued Interest in Soviet products if the discouraging status of the foreign inventor remained. The Soviet solution to these ills **was** the Decree of 1959.

VI. THE DISCOVERY LAW , 1959.4965

The era of the 1960's was to see a great hue and cry for the advancement of society through technological achievement. The first orbiting satellite, Sputnik, did as much to revolutionize science as any previous major theory or technological break­through. The scientific mania increased to an even greater pitch as men sought not only to reach the moon but the stars. Not sur­prisingly, other areas of science besides space technology re­ceived increasing amounts of research and development funds. Such was the frenzied time under which the new Soviet patent law of 1959 was born.

Several good comprehensive summaries and explanations of the 1959 law and the attendant revisions are available.99 Two es­pecially excellent treatises on the subject are the "Report of the United Kingdom Delegation to the Soviet Union" and "Soviet Law on Inventions and Patents" by P. J. Federico.100 The 1959 law is probably the most studied and well-known of all the Soviet patent legislation.

"A Statute on Discoveries, Inventions and Innovation Pro;-- posals," Decree no. 459 of April 24, 1959, went into effect on

101

May **lp** 1959. It included a regulation providing a remuneration

scale plus privileges for rewarding inventors. The general provisions and Intent were very similar to the 1941 and 1931 laws; the inventor could request either a certificate of authorship or patent (Sec. 4)7 rationalizations were covered as "Innovation proposals" (Sec. 7). The general development of the law was '

-65-

to be carried out by the Committee for Inventions and Discoveries attached to the Council of Ministers, USSR, in cooperation with the All-Union Association of Inventors and Innovators)and aided by the industrial enterprises (Sec. 23). Applications were to be examined for both novelty and utility (Sec. 35). Applications for patents were generally the same as before with the usual re­strictions of the highest annual fees in the world (Sec. 47), compulsory license (Sec. 48) and right of the prior user (Sec. 48). Parts VI, VII, VIII and X corresponded, respectively, to processing of innovation proposals; secret discoveries, inventions and in­novation proposals; utilization of inventions and innovation proposals; and compensation for certificate holders.

There were, however, a number of notable differences In the Soviet patent law of 1959. The terms, for one thing, were clarified. A new form of protection called "discoveries" was defined (Sec. 2):

The establishment of a hitherto unknown ob­jective law of nature, property or phenomenon of the material world.

The term "invention" is defined (sec. 3):

The solution of a technical problem dis­tinguished by its essential novelty, in any field of national economy, culture, public health or national defense, which produces positive results.

The nebulous term, "technical improvements," disappears in the 1959 law. All certificates relating to agriculture were to be ~N, issued by the USSR Ministry of Agriculture (Sec. 5). All pro‑

cedures relating to discoveries were established in Section 15; applications for them were to be sent to the USSR Academy of Sciences and related bodies (Sec. 28).

Of very great importance was Section 37. In the case of a certificate of authorship, the Committee for Inventions and riscoveries could request concerned branches of government to present:

conclusions on the utility, industrial novelty, expendiency and procedure for the use of the

supposed Invention.

The procedure was 1n2perative in the case of a patent (Sec. 47). Such a principle was important, because up to 1959, patents and certificates were considered by the same examination procedure.

.1

Another significant adciton was Section 70;

Utilization of Soviet inventions abroad as

well as acquistion of licenses on foreign inventions or foreign patents shall be effected through the

Ministry of Foreign Trade.

This was the first time that a Soviet patent law designated a governmental body to handle the international exchange of patents.

There seem to be several motivating factors and reasons be­hind the law. As with the previous Soviet patent Jaws, protection of new ideas _was_ expanded to encourage the inventor. The new "discovery" provision was probabLy influenced by the tremendous upsweep in the importance of science. Terms were defined more specifically and a general decentralization of the system was instituted to help alleviate controversy and ambiguity. A final

cut between the certificate and patent was effected. Perhaps of greatest importance was the hint at a more international outlook in Soviet patent law as provided in Section 70. Certainly the poor performance of Soviet patenting abroad and the beginning interest in Soviet inventions by the West was starting to break

down the narrow outlook of

predecessors to understand and handle the problems of the industrial and agricultural sectors. Among the the ranks of this new breed of "technobureaucrats" were men like Premier Alexei Kosygin, a former economist1whose policies were not accompanied by the brutish, unsophisticated methods that characterized Stalinist industrial­ization. With a more skillful and practical program, industry pushed itsway upwards and then outwards into the international economic community.

That the Soviets were becoming more aware and more involved in the international patent scene _was_ clearly indicated by the events that took place between 1959 and 1965. As of January of 1959, the USSR and U. S. were involved in a mutual exchange of patents.102 The U. S. acqered copies of 2000 Soviet patents, the first since 1927. In dition, Soviet patents became part

of the novelty search in t e U. S. Patent Office. On May 24, 1959. an Anglo-Soviet trade agree ent was signed, including an article where industrial and technological information exchange was per- mitted between the two countries.103 In 1960, delegations from the Ti. S. and Great Britain visited the USSR to study Soviet

patent law and procedures.

In line with the Rand Development Corp. move of 1959, several U. S. companies, especially the patent holding company called National Patent Development Corp. (NPDC), became interested in Soviet technology in 1961.1 made encouraging progress

toward negotiations with the USSR for the sale and exchange of patent rights as Moscow reshaped its patent policy towards the West. Two reasonsare given for the Soviet move; (1) to improve Soviet industry through the purchase of American technology; and (2) to acquire foreign exchange through licensing of Soviet inventions. Other companies indicated interest in the NPDC owned Soviet patents; the dominance of patent corporations in licensing Soviet inventions was soon to be established.105

As time went on, the initial overtures towards technological exchange between the U. S. and USSR culminated in mutual visits for the purpose of studying the other country's patent and li­censing procedures. A visit by a Soviet delegation composed of E. I. Artemiev, deputy chairman of the Committee for Inventions and Discoveries, I. V. Chervjatov, chief of the division of the same committee, and B. S. Zobnin, deputy chief of the technical division of the Ministry of Foreign Trade was arranged for March, 1962 for the purpose of studying the U. S. patent -system, the pAr­chasing of licenses on U. S. patents and the payment of royar'ties.106. They were to visit not only the U. S. Patent Office but also the patent departments of various companies to study American li­censing techniques. Apparently, NPDC was very much behind this visit. Later in 1962, several U. S. companies sent representa.;. tives to the USSR to study available technology there with a view

107

towards obtaining licenses.

In July of 1962, an indication that all was not well with Soviet patent law came when the USSR announced new patent re­gulations to protect inventions. A Pravada article stated that many inventions were lost due to prior disclosure ,108 One example cited by the Soviet press was Professor 0. B. Bron of the Insti­tute of Electric Energy in Leningrad. Because he failed to patent his discovery of a method for "suppressing magnetic fields in electric motors" outside the USSR, it was used freely abroad with- out license109. Another case was a Professor Velikanov who published an article in a West German journal on his invention, only to have his application for patent "anticipated" (denied) because of the article.110 Under the new regulations, all re­search institutes and other agencies working on technical innova­tions had to first file an application for protection of the invention in the Soviet Union. Reasons for this move seemed to be to: (1) end the occurrence of unfortunate situations like the above; (2) coordinate the reqtrch and inventive effort by assembling such proposals in a central agency; and (3) obtain badly-needed foreign exchange through the sale of patented Soviet inventions abroad.

In conjunction with the above regulations, the USSR sought increased technological exchange with the West by both selling licenses to foreigners wishing them and buying licenses on patented inventions.111 With the rising interest in technological exchange, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade found itself utterly swamped and unable to handle the growing responsibility. As a measure to help the situation, in 1962, the USSR set up a special or

-70-

ganization for foreign patent relations within the Ministry of Foreign Trade.I12 Its name was LICENSINTORG and its function **was** to sell patents and licenses on Soviet inventions and buy rights on foreign technology. Originally, such matters were handled by the separate Soviet trade agencies. A further de­scription of LICENSINTORG and how it appears today can be found in "For Sale: Red Know-How."113

The dominance of the certificate of autAorship continued, as shown by the following table:114

Patents (1959-1963) made up a meager 0.6% of the total. The re­jection rate,based on applications examined)was stiLl extrenely high (79%), undoubtedly for the same reasons as before.

That the Soviets were less than satisfied with Soviet invention is indicated in 1961 by the Soviet economic journal "Ekoonomicheskaya Gazeta."115 It reported that 80% of the 130,000 "new" inventions reported in 1960 to the Soviet government were either invented or patented before. They saw as a reason the reluctance of inventors and research organizations to make proper searches of Information sources. However, the information sources themselves were often poor. It suggested the introduction of patent law

courses into all Soviet technical colleges and patent law advisory groups be set up in the factories. There **was** also cited the pro­blem of bureaucratic disputes.

A final criticism concerned with the malfunction of the Soviet patent structure came from the deputy chairman of the Committee for Inventions and Discoveries, E. Artemiev. He stated that most applications were filed not by the research institutes, but

116

by individual inventors working on their own time. Cited as the trouble **was** the failure of the institutes to register inventions. Less than a third of the applications were from persons in research institutes and only 0.24 (the low figure

Is correct) from the organizations themselves. He talked also of the incorrect point-of-view that a patent was uself-seeking3 and the wastage caused by duplicated work.

Applications for protection of Soviet inventions abroad _was_ starting to increase from the dismally low level of the 1950's. The following table gives a list of Soviet applications abroad In some important countries, /959-1965 (figures in parentheses are patent grants.) ,117

It was not until 1962 that the Soviets got their first invention

lid

patented in the U. S. since 1952. It was no. 3,025,733 to a

N. V. Soodnizin for a powered device used in oil wells. Although the Soviet invention _was_ gaining strength abroad, it still was a long way from competing favorably with other Western countries.

The foreign inventor was in much the same position as before, Perhaps a little better. That the protection of a USSR patent was not totally invalid is related through a story In 1961 of how a-chemical shipment from a West German firm was canceled by the USSR when it was learned that an Italian firm owned a Soviet patent on the chemical process.119 The Italian company then took over trade on the process in the USSR. The following is a table

For the years 1959-1961, 19634965, foreign issues were only about 1% of the totalbut included most of the patents granted. The foreign inventor had taken a greater interest in the Soviet patent processlas indicated by the steady increase in applications) although he was having some difficulty in getting his invention protected. .

The problems that had plagued Soviet patent law in the 1950s continued to bother it in the early 1960's. Theory often did not mesh with practice. There were ideological hangups on patents as forms of "self-seeking” and "monopolies battling for

-73-

markets." Frequently, both the Soviet inventor and the govern­mental official in charge lacked the basic knowledge of how to get a patent or how to obtain a license.

Perhaps the greatest worry of ail was that the relation of Soviet inventions abroad and foreign inventions to the USSR was ambiguous as long as the Soviet Union was not a member of the international patent convention, Soviet patent law itself was Incompatible with the large amounts of licensing desired by the Soviets because the procedures and institutions were often non­existent or unsatisfactory. If the Soviet Union remained aloof much longer from the international patent agreement, the improved technological exchange with the West would soon stagnate or de­cline. Thrusting "ideological" considerations aside and pushing "practical" necessities to the front, the USSR took a deep plunge and joined the Paris Convention in 1965.

VII. SOVIET ACCESSION TO THE PARIS CONVENTION, 1965-1973

The move by the USSR to join the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property was met with astonishment, optimism and caution. Po some it **was** a time of some embarrass­ment as the theory of the day was that the Soviet Union was neither interested in becoming a member) nor likely to move in that direction.121 It was certainly one of the most significant events in international patent history and one which, I feel, signaled a new era in Soviet patent law.

In the early 1960s, there had been several hints that the Soviets were interested in joining the Paris Convention but it was not until'. March 16, 1965 that E. Artemiev announced the

USSR's intention to do **so.**122 Final acceptance was to be effective July 1, 1965 and it was stressed that international recognition of the certifinqte of authorship might be a necessary requirement. Most of my discussion will come from "The Significance of the Soviet Accession to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property" which has an excellent overview of the events surrounding the participation of the Convention's 68th member.123

Before moving into the subject of the Soviets and internation­al patent law, it will be necessary to set down some historical and factual background of the Convention itself. It is based

on an old agreement origAnating in Paris on march 20, 1883 and hence the name, the Paris Convention. Its primary function was to organize general rules to protect inventors applying for patents

-75-

In the various member nations. By far the most important part of the Convention is Article 4 which gives the inventor holding a patent in one member country a priority of one year for filing in another member nation. However, the Convention has very little enforcement power other than "moral condemnation." There have

been several instances of member countries violating its provisions.

The reasons or possible reasons for the Soviet accession form quite a list. One **was** the West's reluctance to part with technological information for fear that the Soviets were onLy Interested in buying models to copy rather than long term agree­ments. In line with this was the Soviets wish to collect tech­nical information. A third was the possible desire of the SovIet Union to influence the patent law in "third world" countries.

Two other important problems that the Soviet Union wished to solve by the Paris Convention related back to previous times.

One was the Soviet desire to become more involved in internation­al licensing arrangements. Another concerned the advancement of Soviet technology. As industrial sophistication increassed in the USSR, technological "piracy" was becoming more of a two-way street with the Soviets feeling that they were often on the losing end. By joining the Convention, the USSR hoped to correct the situation.

The meshing of Soviet patent law with the Paris Convention was somewhat of a problem. Generally, Soviet patent law was not oriented to the international sphere. Section 33 of the 1959 law was inconsistent with the priority provision of Article 4 under the Convention. The compulsory licensing provisions of the USSR were too strict. To bring their law more in line with

the Convention, the Soviets amended various parts of their patent

iZ4

law (Decree of March 17, 1965). Section 33 of the 1959 statute

wastvended as follows;

With respect to foreign citizens and foreign juridical persons, priority of an inventor in accordance with any international agreement to which the USSR is a party shall be established as the date of priority of the first application in proper form submitted in a country also partic­ipating in this convention if the application of the USSR Is submitted before the passage of 12 months from such date.

A person wishing to use the priority estab‑

lished In accordance with the international

agreement immediately upon filing his application

must present a request to this Cpriority]

This **was** the most important change. Two others were to make Section 39 conform with the amendment to Section 33 and the addition of Sections 78 and 79 which were concerned with inventions used on a means of transport>and "exhibition" priorities.

Perhaps the greatest stumbling block for agreement concerned the status of the certificate of authorship. Article 4 of the Convention gives priority on protection to patents, but is silent on new forms of protection like the certificate. Section 71 of the Soviet patent law of 1959 states:

With respect to the protection of the rights

of an inventor abroad, an inventor's certificate

[C. of A-4 shall be deemed equivalent to a patent.

However, only an amendment to the Paris Convention would clarify its status.

The effort to have the certificate of authorship recognized

-77-

an equivalent to a patent in its international priority rights goes back to the convening of the Paris Convention at Lisbon

125

In 1958. At the conference, a Rumanian led Eastern bloc attempt to have the certificate given Article 4 status was defeated. Apparently, the majority **view to** deny the motion was not a re­jection of the certificate but simply indicated anfamiliarity with its features and a need for further study before making a final decision. An Intergovernmental Study Group (January, 1964) was convened for this express purpose.

When the Soviet Union decided to join the Convention, another study group called the Committee of Experts was formed in order to deal with the question.126

This group came to the bonclunion that: (1) description and filing of a certificate was generally the same as a patent t (2) the procedure for granting and revocation was almost the same for both patents and certificates; (3) for­eigners of member nations have the right to apply for either form of protection; and (4) certificates guaranteed the inventor protection for his invention, rewarded him and, at the same time, delegated to the State the right to exploit the subject of the invention. The same group recommended that the question of the certificate of authorship be taken up at the diplomatic confer­ence at Stockholm in 1967 with the proposal that Article 4 be amended to include it.

Before the Stockholm convrntion in 1967, several private and public patent groups came out in favor of the revision. The President's Commission on the Patent System recommended in **its** Report of November 17, 1966 that:127

To promote a more harmonious international relations, particularly with regard to the pro­tection of industrial property: The United States should take a position in favor of thB proposed revision of the Paris. Convention whereby a right of priority may be based on an application for an ['author's] certificate.

At Tokyo in April, 1966, the International Association for the Protection of Industrial Property (AIPPI)yof which the USSR is now a member, resolved that Article 4 should be amended to in­clude the certificate of authbrship.

It is there'-fore not surprising that the Stockholm conven­tion made the following changes in Article 4 of the Paris Conven‑

t

Applications for Lauthors'i certificates filed in a country in which applicants have the right to apply at their own option either for a patent or for an .lithor'S_] certificate shall give rise to therhtofpripy provided by this Article, under the same conditions and with the same effects as applications for patents.

The above amendments were subject to confirmation by alL the mem­ber countries. Not until 1973 did the U. S. finally ratify the Stockholm convention so that the certificate of authorship could

of NAM and indicated the desire to expandAinterchange of technology

here were a multitude of reactions and possible consequences as a result of Soviet accession to the Convention. Edward _J._ Brenner, U. S. Comissioner of Patents, hailed the move as he believed it "could form the basis for increased cooperation be­tween the USSR and the U. S. in this field."129 The news was generally received with caution In the U. S. although the State repartment welcomed the move.130 With increased faith by the

West in Soviet patent protection, it was expected that the Soviet- West patent and licensing arrangements would rise in volume.

With it generally thought that the status of the certificate of authorship would be resolved, there was a new, exciting possi­bility at hand.131 A foreign inventor could obtain a Soviet certificate, pay next to no fees and still have a year's priority in the member nations. All search work for novelty and utility would be done by the Soviet government at no charge. When Ar­ticle 4 was amended by the Stockholm convention, the possibility changed to reality. Although the impact of this new situation

on future developments in international patent law will be handled in my summary, let me say now that probably one of the cheapest forms of priority protection in the history of the patent has became available in th shape of the Soviet certificate of author­ship.

In line with the USSR becoming part of the international patent family, the era 1965-1973 was characterized by an increase in the licensing and the flow of technological information. In 1965, two Soviet officials, the fatiliar E. Artemiev)and V. Salymovsky, president of LICENSINTORG, attended a conference

-80-

with the West. It has been my good fortune to have obtained a copy of the test of Artemiev's speech before this conference. The contents centered on two themes important to Soviet patent law. The first was a general outline of the Soviet procedure for protecting inventions)with particular emphasis on how Soviet inventions were implemented into the economy:132

The Soviet State Committee on inventions -aftd discoveries executes not only functions of control and registration, but also participates In selecting inventions with the aim to introduce them in Soviet industry; and that, of course, means more thorough consideration.

The other perhaps more important subject was Soviet patent

law and its interaction with the patent laws of other countries:133

It is only logical that international aspects of the problem are getting now Into focus of attention. These aspects are closely connected with the extension of world trade and exchanges between countries in science and technology, in­cluding the countries with different social systems, and, due to that, with the questions of legal protection of industrial property. .

Many inventions (there are about 600 of them now), which are protected by author's certificates in the USSR, are protected by patents in the West. It Is one more proof, that the author's certificate and a patent are equal and legally adequate as documents protecting the inventions.

At the same time, legislature of my country providefor the patent system as a means of piro­tection of therights for invention. We maintain the patent system first of all as a form of pro­tecting inventions, to which applicants from other countries are accustomed. Functioning this way, the patent plays a useful role, creating a legal basis for economic cooperation of the USSR with Western countries.

Meanwhile, it has been shown in the works

of Soviet economists, that such patent procedures

are important for foreign firms expanding them­selves in the Soviet market, when the selling of equipment goes together with the selling of technological processes. .

However, Artemiev concluded that patent contact between the U, S. and the USSR **was** minimal and suggested ways for improving the situation:1)4

There are the broad possibilities to extend the exchange of commodities and technology between the USSR and the U. S. The basis for one of them could be our patent ties, which we: consider as one of the parts of this basis, on which economic cooperation and peaceful coexistence of our states can be reliably built. .

We propose to study the possibilities to multiply forms of exchange of technoLogy. In particular, we are prepared to conclude not only separate license contracts, but permanent agree­ments on the exchange of patent right and technical Information between your companies and us.

With the USSR finally in the Paris Convention, there was

a renewed effort to not only obtain licenses on Soviet inventions but also make Soviet patent law more accessible and compatible to foreign inventors. In 1966, Soviet state organizations told U. S. companies that there was no rule against licensing agree­ments for Soviet processes. Included as additional enticements were trips to Moscow for the purpose of concluding agreements.135 As takeover of the role National Patent Development Corp. played in the early 1960's, Patent Maragment Inc. (PMT), a technology transfer and patent holding company began talks in 1968 with LICENSINTORG on licensing various areas of Russian metallurgy.136

Further patent agreements between the USSR and U. S. were

- 82‑

sought. While in Moscow in 1969, William E. Schuyler, Jr.,

U. S. Commissioner of Patents met with ranking soviet trade of­ficials to discuss improvements In American-Soviet cooperation concerning patents.137 No treaties on patents were formed but Commissioner Schuyler was optimistic about future talks. It was A fitting occasion as a symposium was being heLd at the same time

to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lenin's decree on inventions.

In 1971, group visits of the Soviets to Washington and Americans to.Noscow on the subject of patents were arranged. Three Soviet officials arrived in March, 1971 to study the U. S. Patent Office and the various patent departments of several companies to learn American licensing techniques and the use of computers in patent management.138 Commissioner Schuyler re­turned the visit in June in order to study the prospects and pro­cedures for licensing American inventions in the USSR.139 He also proposed to Soviet officials a plan where American inventors would use the USSR's "dual" patenting system by taking out patents on basic inventions and certificates on subsequent improvements, hoping to derive double benefit of protection and utilization.

By the 1970's. interest by the U. S. in Soviet technology had grown rapidly. In 1972, PMI got the rights to various Rus­sian inventions, including the much sought after eiectroslag

40 .

remelting process (ESR):1 That same year, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp, purchased technical information and licenses through PMI on the Soviet process for the manufacture of alumi­num.141 Such technological purchases tend to emphasize not only the excellent quality of the capital goods in the USSR but also the importance placed by the Soviets on heavy industry.

Since the products of Soviet industry were becoming quite attractive to the Western businessman, the Soviet inventor _was_ put under an increasing amount of pressure to make his inventions known abroad. In 1965, Premier Kosygin ordered Soviet technol­ogists to "stop hiding their saleable industrial know-haw and

0.42 start patenting and peddling it abroad.

But there were still problems in Soviet patenting) both at home and abroad) sincethe USSR joined the Paris Convention, as illustrated by the following story;143

When a visitor asked a Siberian engineer,

"What is the best in the West?" in response to a description of anew bridge, the engineer pulled out a battered, coverless copy of Electronics

dated August 10, 1964 and pointed. The visitor

then asked whether anything better had been

developed and the engineer said he was not sure

as information was sketchy and slow to arrive.

The article from which the preceding story was quoted taiked of reforms in Soviet patent practice, including new sources of in­formation, coordination of patenting and licensing, and agencies to systematically select inventions for patenting abroad. Before, the organization was often formidable on paper but poor in prac­tice, as most agencies were unfamiliar with patenting and licens­ing. "Many design offices •do not know the road to the Inventions Discoveries Institute (Committee)," complained Yuri Maksarev,

144

chairman of the parent committee.- When such organizations did

apply for patent protection, the chances were 2 to 1 against a grant, "To put up with such a situation any longer would be

a+

to agree to great losses this country would incur bothAhome an

In foreign markets." To Stimulate compliance with these measures, substantial monetary incentives were dangled before the interested research institutes and republic departmentsconcerned with in­ventions.

Acknowledgement of the problems of non-utilization and pub­lication of Soviet inventions and discoveries also came from another Soviet source:145

The Statute on the Committee on Inventions and Discoveries presently in force, .

does not oblige the committee to inform the re­levant planning agencies of the country .

about discoveries here and abroad for the purpose of employing them in the economy. . • . this work is episodic and random in practice and, consequently, ineffective. . . in our opinion, the legally established responsibility of ministries and agencies to select the most promising discoveries and to assure their future utilization is not being exercised actively enough.

, Therefore, we cannot agree with the proposal to repeal the rule in Point 28 of the Statute of Discoveries, Inventions, and Rational­ization of Proposals of 1959. It seems to us that the task is not to eliminate the present procedure for publishing information on discoveries in academic publications but to adhere to it un­swervingly.

Although the article is concerned primarily with scientific discoveries, it does illustrate some of the difficulties that plagued the law of 1959 and its later revisions.

966, 42 of this unique

he growing number of Soviet-owned U. S. patents started to assume direct significance in 1972 with the first case of in­fringement action on a U. S. patent issued to a Soviet inventor. No sooner was the patent, no. 3,670,089)offthe press' than PNI, patent agent for the inventor, sued five U. S. companies for alleged "illegal" use of the invention. Although the companies involved shrugged off the legal action as no more than a "nui‑

sance," it was obvious that situations such as the above were going to force American industry to give more than "token" con­sideration to patented Soviet processes in the future.

Even more encouraging than the success of Soviet inventors was the status of the foreign inventor after Soviet accession to the Convention. Foreign patenting in the USSR after 1965 showed that outside interest in Soviet patent protection was on a definite upswing:149

Grants to foreign inventors now made up 4% of the total issues. a four-fold increase over the previous six-year period. That total patent grants had now risen to 4% is due almost entirely to this increased enthusiasm by foreign inventors for Soviet patent protection. Even the certificate of authorship (B% of total foreign issues) was becoming more attractive to the would- be foreign applicant. It remains to be seen whether the cer­tificate will increase in popularity in view of the cheap priority protection it could afford.

With the improved position for foreign inventors in the USSR, Commissioner Schuyler in 1971 criticized the failure of Americans to licensemore inventions in the Soviet Union.150

He suggested two ways to do this (1) be more active in trade exhibitions organized in the USSR; and (2) deal with LICENSINTORG. Such a request was not without basis because the foreign inventor was often a long way towards successful sale of a license if he owned a Soviet patent, A speech on foreign patenting in the USSR given by Vladimir Kuryshev, depty chief of the Patent Department of the USSR Chamber of Commerce, before the American Patent Law Association on February 1, 1974 further supports the contention:151

This is not to minimize the value of a USSR

patent as a patent owner, when trading with USSR

obtains considerable advantages. If the patented

article Is of interest to a Soviet organization,

iI_MAL_hy_ials_laa_th_e_satented article from the

patent owner and cannot buy it from_any_pther firm.

_ _

Thus, the character of the USSR patent is more of a prohibiting nature than of an allowing nature. These advantages are embodied not only in

concluding foreign trade deals which foresee the import of the patented product, but in license

agreements as well, based on inventions, important or necessary for Soviet industry. Soviet law

stipulates the possibility to conclude such agree­ments.

Despite the tremendous improvement in the exchange of tech­nology, particularly between the U. S. and the USSR, there were many problems yet unsolved. The nagging headache of implementa­tion of Soviet patent law inside the USSR remained. Soviet law was still not sufficiently oriented towards international patent practice. There was general acknowledgement that Soviet Insti­tutions, like LICENSINTORG, set up to handle foreign exchange of technical information were tremendously inefficient:152

The slow penetration of Soviet technology here is not due only to 2:atent barriers and U. S. reluctance to buy. [It isj Russia's own flbureau­crati6,3 maze that impedes decision-making.

Included among the complaints were the difficulties encountered In obtaining information about the Soviet technology available and the marathon negotiations required to conclude licensing agreements, as related by an executive of a company experienced In these arduous transactions:153

The Russians tend to use the platoon approach. One group gets as many concessions as it can. Then a different agency comes in, and the pro­cedure repeats itself.

Yet even with these frustrating problems, there had been tremendous progress towards greater technological interchange between East and West, from the early 1960's to the 19701s. The article from which the above criticisms came makes clear that once a licensing pact was made, the Soviets not only keiri- up their end of the bargain but future agreements were much easier to conclude as well. The mammoth increase in foreign applications in the USSR Is lust another indication that Soviet patent law is here to stay.

In the preceding pages, I have talked about the history of Soviet patent **law,** from its primitive start in 1919 up to the new law to go into effect in 1974. It is time now to consider broadly the question of how a collectivist society, like the Soviet Union, protected inventive spirit.

_ASS__ESSMENT ,_ 1 91 9-1 973

We now return to Taussig's question, "How shall a collect­ivist society achieve the same result." From the preceding chap­ters, it should be very apparent by now that there are, indeed, two parts to the problem, one concerning the internal organization of a socialist patent law, the other of how to blend this social- 1St solution into the framework of international_ patent law. As we have before us a case history of the course of Soviet patent law from 1919 to 1974, the first objective will be to point out how the U6,911 was able to answer the two-part question to see if they succeeded in their attempt. From this answer, we can then speculate on what the Soviet experience means as one way to pro­tect inventive spirit. Included in the discussion are some un­usual yet interesting thoughts by both Soviet and non-Soviet socialist writers.

Before launching into my uwn explanation of the USSR's re­sponse to patent law, T would first _Like to present two differing ideas on how Soviet patent law couLd be viewed to see if they offer a plausible answer to our question as well as a starting point for my own thoughts. The first which I have labeled the Socialist Legality model comes from a paper written around 1962 by a Georgetown University law student. It is called "Soviet Patent Law and Socialist Legality."154 The paper approaches Soviet patent law via the following premise:

-90-

Since it is clear from a study of socialist legality that the law is fundamentally "the ex­haltation of a political party dictatorship," it in now apparent that Soviet patent law must

122_422ma2litl_LI_LallarlIaEL_211flia_aljier,1_1tol environment.

In this context, the paper attempts to prove: (1) that Soviet patent law must be approached as part of the overall Soviet legal system; and (2) that the patent law might be altered at any time to meet the new needs of the ruling party.

From this model, the answer to our question is that)over the years)Soviet patent law has changed back and forth at the will of the ruling party. Such a statement has obvious difficulties In explaining the events following the 1931 law. Between 1919 and 1931, the model might have a case for its contention, but

to Imply that Soviet patent law was formed in a haphazard fashion in the era of Soviet heavy industrialization is clearly a mis­understanding of the directed course that Soviet patent protection took from the 1930's on. The conclusion that Soviet patent law was changed literally at the whir of the ruling party applies to only a small part of Soviet patent history at best.

A second point-of-view which I have termed the Inventive Spirit model comes from an article written **in** 1960 called "The New Structure of the Protection of Industrial Property in Eastern Europe."155 It deals with the problem in general for the Eastern bloc countries but much of what is said can be and is applied to the USSR. The author gives the lack of inventive spirit in Tsarist Russia as the reason why the Soviet Union reviewed the classical conception of protection for invention and took a ail‑

-91-

ferent course to encourage such spirit. He found that the system of protection afforded by middle Eastern European countries was unfavorable to foreigners seeking to acquire industrial property rights (1 agree). He finds the expanded protection a means to awaken inventive spirit. However, the author fans down badly when he predicts that the Soviet Union would not join the inter­national patent convention.

The two preceding examples get at parts of the problem of socialism and patent law. The Socialist Legality model contends that Soviet patent law wavered in its course while the inventive L21E1t. model argues that prior conditions necessitated a change from Tsarist patent law. However, they are both deficient for the very reason that they do take such limited points-of-view. That the thoughts by the socialists of pre-Soviet times on invention either by chance or by design are part of Soviet patent law cannot be denied. Their mark can be seen not only on the Decree of 1919 but most especially on that of the law of 1931 and laws afterward. Invention was to be linked to industry, society was to move for­ward with the help of technology. Yet the law of 1924 and the present Soviet patent policy today are hard to explain in these terms. The practical need often entered into the calculations. So I feel that neither ideological nor pragmatic arguments alone, are the answer; both had to play their part. The bold concept of having the inventor give up his exploitive right to the State had to be tempered by some material reward

In order to get at the entire question of how the Soviet Union decided to stimulate and protect inventive spirit, I am of the opinion that you must not only fuse the ideological and

practical considerations together, but also look at the history of Soviet patent law as three distinct yet complementary stages. The first was an experimental phase that spanned both the Decree of 1919 and the NEP law of 1924. Faced with rebuilding a decrepit industrial plant in near anarchy, as well as bringing to life an apparently lethargic Russian inventive spirit, the early Bolshevik exploits into patent law reflect the very confused nature of the times. The almost farcical attempt to "nationalize" patents through the Decree of 1919 wasAdisastrous failure. Pure "altruism" proved a very inadequate substitute to Tsarist patent law.

When it became obvious that the Decree of 1919 could not fill the void left by the abolition of patents, the Soviets switched back to a regularized system of patent protection and registration in the law of 1924. Much like the change from War Communism to the NEP, the implementation of a "capitalistic" patent law was not a refutation of socialism but simple acknow­ledgement that until a practical socialist alternative could be found, they would have to make do with established procedure to fill the needs of the situation. In the 1920t5, the Bolsheviks were more controllediby, rather than controlling, the events in the formation of their patent law.

Although significant parts of the Decree of 1919 and the law of 1924 were at opposite ends of the patent law spectrum, it is clear to me that certain desirable features of each were united to form the future course of Soviet patent law. The abolition of previous patent rights, along with the expropriation of future inventions by the government foreshadowed the coming of the cer­tificate of authorship and the decline of the patent in the USSR.

even the "free-enterprise" law of 1924 with **its** rather vague compulsory licensing provisions hinted at the final move towards greater government control over the inventive process. Thus much of the spadework for the patent law of 1931 had already been accomplished by the late 19201s.

When the _law_ of 1931 finally did replace the old 1924 law, not only was a new era in Soviet patent law ushered in, but

a new course for the protection of inventive spirit was unveited as well, I have called this second sage in the history of Soviet patent law "internalization" because it is in the period after 1931 that the USSR gave its solution to how a socialist society would stimulate it own inventive effort. As a supporting part to the heavy industrialization initiated by Stalin, the major thrust of Soviet patent law **was** to help inventiveness at home and build up industry through these newly protected processes or products sol that invention was linked formally to the desires of Soviet economic planning.

To accomplish such an objective, a new form of protection for inventive genius was established through a unique document called the certificate of authorship. In return for various rewards and privileges, the inventor gave up his expoitive right to the State. Other forms of previously non-patentable material, such as scientific discoveries, were included to make the system as useful and as attractive as possible. Such a process not only encouraged the would-be inventor, but also made it easier for

the experts in patents and industry to gather in all the suggestions for utilization in the appropriate areas of the Soviet economy. Since about 99% of all inventions registered in the USSR from

1931 to 1959 were certificates, it _is_ clear that Soviet patent law was succeeding in its goal of channeling the activity of the Soviet inventor.

As the certificate of authorship rose in stature, the patent shrank In importance in the USSR. With all application procedures rigged to make the patent as unattractive as **posOle** to the Soviet inventor, it is not surprising. In addition, the most likely candidate for the patent, the foreign inventor, was un­doubtedly discouraged by its extremely limited protection. The certificate provided even fewer benefits for the foreign appli­cant. Since it is very plain from the patent laws following 1931 that the domestic inventor was to be given a preferred status in the USSR, it is possible that the unusual forms of Soviet patent protection were used as a means to chase away the unwanted foreign Inventor.

The question of whether there _was_ any other reasonable course for Soviet patent law after 1931 is purely a matter for conjecture. Certainly the Great Debate of the middle to late 1920's indicates that the direction of Soviet industrialization was still very much in doubt. But once It was decided that the economy would be controlled by the demands of heavy industry, the need for at least some ideological, economic and political consistency in Soviet patent law necessitated a change from "normal" practice; the "free-enterprise" law of 1924 proved incapable of adjustment to the Five-Year plan. But even when the State was given the sole exploitive right to the Invention, they had to make some con­cessions to the inventor to make their patent law woryor the Decree of 1919 was a sad reminder that prestige alone would not

stir the inventor to creative effort.

Until the late 1950'8, Soviet patent law treaded its own lonely path. It was only after 1959 that the USSR shifted to a new line of patent Policy, particlarly evident after the USSR

joined the Paris Convention in 1965. 1 have called the new

policy "internalization" because it is only after 1959 that Soviet patent protection started to cometo grips with the pro‑

blem of **how to** relate a socialist patent law to a distinctly

alien international environment. A clear statemnt of the Soviet

position is given by M. Kuzmin, deputy chairman of the Committee

for Inventions and Discoveries: 156

The most important direction in the use of Soviet inventions lies in obtaininp foreign patents which creates favourable conditions for expanding exports of machinery and license marketing. .

To promote these practices, a special de‑

cision was adopted by the Soviet Government in 196?. • . . • Ministries and departments were re‑

quired to carry out systematic selection of In‑

ventions for their patenting abroad and make their suggestions as regards license marketing; their annual plans were expected to envisage the intro­duction into the national economy of inventions patented abroad with the view of license marketing.

The policy of encouraging the Soviet inventor was continued as in the preceding thirty-odd years,but the emphasi5was not pri‑

marily on implementation of Soviet invention into home industry but towards selling it abroad.

Two important reasons can be given for the change in Soviet patent priorities. One is the policy of "peaceful coexistence" initiated under Khrushchev. If nothing else, the Soviet Union desired recognition as a fellow member in the international

patent market.

Perhaps a more .significant consideration was the growth in Soviet industry, both in quantity and quality. Before 1959, it was obvious that the USSR had very little to offer for sale) as indicated by the large purchases and occasional "pirating" of technological expertise from the more advanced industrial nations during the 19501s. But after 1959, Soviet industry had gained such tremendous momentum and sophistication thatthe former "pirate-," the USSR, was finding itself pilfered of its new break­throughs in technology by its previous "victims, the Western industrial powers. The exchange was no longer to its liking

or advantage. In order to get licenses for its patented processes, while at the same time obtaining the desired technology in those deficient'areaS in Soviet industry, the USSR found it necessary

to shed its former role of "patent buccaneer" and become a respected member of the patent community.

When the USSR made the move to 3oin the Paris Convention in 1965, it **was** confronted by a number of obstacles, not the least of which was whether its primary form of protection, the certif­icate of authorship, would be recognized internationally. The amendments to Article 4 of the charter at Stockholm in 1967 clarified this important point. For all intents and purposes, the certificate was deemed equivalent to a patent.

However, other equally important problems in the interna­tional development of Soviet patent law, such as more equitable treatment for the foreign inventor, still loomed as large as ever. To buttress an almost nonexistent licensing process. LICENSINTORG was formed in 1962 to deal with technological ex‑

-97-

change. The various orders by the government to the Soviet in­ventor to pool his technical processes for exploitation abroad give clear illustration to a system that often existed only on paper. Even the established Soviet patent and licensing insti­tutions **like** LICENSTNTORG and the USSR Chamber of Commerce have proved immensely distasteful to foreign corporations and inventors.

Most of the above difficulties stem from a Soviet patent law that is plainly lagging behind the desires of thlSoviet government, The policy of increasing the technological flow of information on an international scale is inconsistent with patent protection that emphasizes the Soviet inventor to the virtual exclusion of foreign'inventors. Some modifications or revisions must be instituted to brine Soviet patent law in line with Soviet patent policy, The process of conversion to an international patent oue-Took has just begun in the USSR.

Even though the Soviet patent system has been in existence only about fifty years and is still experienceing numerous "teeth­ing" problems, the ramifications and implications of this unique socialist course are already affecting the thoughts and practice of patent law in general. In many Eastern bloc countries, some form of protection similar to the certificate of authorship exists. In many non-Communist nations today, the rapid national­ization of industry by tome of these countries is going to force them to look carefully at the Soviet experience.

One unusual aspect of Soviet patent law that has created

some controversy is the principle of numerous forms of protection for inventive spirit, even if such "spirit" does not fall into the classical definition of "patentable" subject matter, In

the essay "New Forms of Protection for Intellectual Property in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia," S. _J._ Slotysinski makes what I think is an extremely valid and embarrassing comment about the conventional patent system that protects certain classes of intellecttal property yet ignores other analogous forms of creative activity at the same time:157

The system of intellectual property has often been subject to severe criticism. For instance, while authors and inventors may enjoy copyrights or patents, scientist sandotheizMijilL,gl creators can claim no benefits fftfm-the industrial

• exploitation of their ideas which are considered an non-patentable or non-copyrightable subject- matter. .

In order to explain the discrimination be­tween discoverers and inventors, it has been

often argued that the discoverer merely establishes something which has always existed in nature, whereas the inventor both enriches human know­ledge and discloses a new useful resialt The ar­gument that the invention'. represents a higher level of human creativity can only be inconclusive

. It cannot be denied that scientific discoveries contribute imm ely to technological and economic development.

Obviously, scientific discoveries require just as .much genius and creative ability as any invention or novel. Yet they remain unprotected and unrewarded in Western industrial powers such as the U. S. To continue this attitude is clearly a travesty of the principle behind both patents and copyrights. Countries like the U. S. would be taking a giant step towards equitable protection of all "intellectual" property by following the USSR's example in the case of scientific discoveries.

Since the certificate of authorship is now officially re­cognized as 12Eallx equivalent to the patent by the Paris Convention,

-99-

a new problem arises. Even though the certificate and patent are in many ways similar, the fact remains that they imply very different forms of exploitive right. The trouble that "dual" protection for industrial property could cause was considered

over twenty years ago in a paper, "Nationalization and International Patent Relations," when, strangely enough, the potential danger was very remote.-58 The study attempted to examine: (1) the position of the citizen-patentee amid sociali§t institutions; (2) the position of a foreign patentee in petitioning for and holding patents in a nationalized economy; and (3) the significance of a foreign sovereign's acquiring or holding patents in the jurisdiction of anOther government.

From the first two questions the author concludes, reasonably, that the inventor in a socialist society is channeled.'in-hi8. actions by the government. His answer to point (3) is that the nationalizing government is in a position to interfere substantial­ly in the economic life of other countries. He goes on to say:

sPe

As we shall, this situation is likely to be

aggravated when the future technology originating with governments with nationalized industries or governments supporting large-scale research endeavors with public funds seek and acquire patents in foreign jurisdictions. .

The bare fact of a sovereign's holding United States patents is of little consequence. The situation becomes problematic when the patents are used in a manner to further the economic welfare of one country at the expense of another.

The patent relationships between this country

Sa, its nationals and the Soviet Union are so few and so fugitive as to make it unnecessary to take up the position of the USSR in the live questions under discussion.

This essay was written in 1947 when the USSR was not very much interested in patenting abroad. The acceptance of the certificate of authorship internationally might require closer consideration of the problem. However, it would take a few years of careful study and Compilation Of data to decide whether measures might have to be taken to cope with the possibility.

As indicated before, the patent law of the developing "third- world" nations could be influenced by a socialist form of patent protection. An article by I. Tchervyakov and G. Tytzkayacalled "Some Problems faced by the Developing Countries in the Field of Legal Protection of Inventions" shows that such a correlation has not escaped the attention of the Soviets. It is interesting to note that many of the comments made in this essay have their parallel to the situation that confronted Soviet Russia in its early years:159

• • . a large group of the countries of Asia, Africa and some countries of Latin America con­tinue to use the legislation adopted back in the colonial period, and a number of countries have

no legislation on protection of inventions at all. Sooner or later these countries will face the problem of renewal of invention legislation, .

. It seems thattheinew legal regulations should fix and attribute to realization of eco­nomic means of the industrialization problem. Such means are essentially both provision and use of home scientific and technological achievements, as well as use of foreign-made ones. Use of imported technology only is dangerous for develop­ing countries as it may turn them into an economic appendage of capitalism. It follows, therefore, from the above-said that the main stress should be laid on home-made scientific and technological developments, and imported accomplishments should be made subordinate to them.

-101-

Tchervyakov and Tytzkaya suggest that the certificate of author­ship might be more practical than the patent in the deveLoping nations of the world for the following reasons: (1) possibility of free use of inventions by any enterprise of the state sector; (2) distribution of the information providing for their faster use; (3) establishment of state control over the use of the in­vention; and (4) stimulation of creative activities of inventors owing to the grant of certain privileges.160 Although they never

**be**

state it explicitly, the certificate could probablyAused as a kind of "tariff" barrier to help the emerging domestic inventor along and thus serve as a means for gainitg economic independence and control.

Arguments over whether the certificate of authorship or

the patent is a more equitable form of protection have frequently degenerated into Ideological "hair-splitting" and just plain refusal to budge from the established routine. Each document has a valid basis in its awn particular ideological, political and economic environment. I certainly could not imagine the Soviet patent system being applied to the U. S., nor could I see U. S. patent law working very satisfactorily in the USSR.

That is why I think the statement made by many Western legal authorities that the Soviet form of protection for invention is merely a system of employee bonuses is grossly unfair. While the patentee gets his reward through the licensing of his in­vention, the certificate holder obtains his immediately from the State. In each case, the result is the same: the inventor receives some form of compensation, although there could be some argument over the amount and nature. When you consider further

that the procedure for application is not much different, be

it patent in the U. S. or certificate of authorship in the USSR, it is very odd to deem one a form of protection for industrial property and the other not. In fact, I am of the opinion that the Soviet system)with its protection for scientific discoveries and the process of determining the utility of inventions in in­dustry3has certain advantages unavailable in a conventional patent system.

So rather than trying to make what can only be a moral judgement, I think it is better to just present the Soviet course In patent law as a new way for accomplishing the same objective, the protection of inventive spirit, and applaud it as a remark­able piece of legislation. That the USSR still has much to do yet before it is done with its patent law is equally plain to me.

0.

Atn the Soviet and foreign inventor alike face immense bureau‑

cratic, ideologic and linguistic barriers in their attempt to obtain protection for their "flashes of genius." But the pro­gress from the slow start in 1919 to the busy Soviet patent system of today has been both significant and illuminating for the dis­cussion of how a patent law could be constructed. Even if the certificate of authorship should go completely out of style (unlikely), the question of whether there are alternatives to the patent can never again be answered with a dogmatic "no."
