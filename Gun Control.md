The right to bear arms is based on the right to self-defense. While some o’s do not like it, this is based on self-ownership or self-sovereignty, as Rand explained

Is man a sovereign individual who owns his person, his mind, his life and its products – or is he the property of the tribe …

Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, What is Capitalism, p 10.

If a man owns himself then he has a right to self-defense. This right to self-defense is limited to immediate defense under a proper government, not retaliatory force. In other words you can use any reasonable means to defend yourself if you are attacked, but you cannot say wait until a year later attack someone and claim self-defense. It also means that you cannot shoot someone for say walking across your lawn, unless they present an immediate plausible threat to your life. However, you may brandish a gun, a knife, or a howitzer to suggest that the person leave your property. The actions you take in self-defense have to be reasonable, but the tools in themselves cannot be considered unreasonable. Preemptive laws (regulations) are always the initiation of force by the government and always a violation of rights and therefore not part of a proper government. Governments can only do that which is prescribed, while private citizens may do anything that which is not proscribed. Note that in the revolutionary war the US would not have had any cannons if they had not been owned by private citizens.

Additionally, there is no evidence that outlawing guns has any beneficial results. In fact, the evidence is overwhelming that outlawing guns results in increased violent crime. This has been shown at the city level, the state level, and in multiple countries. Finally, the press always ignores all the people whose lives were saved because someone had a gun, such as the Colorado Springs Church shooting.

Gun control is wrong both on a practical and a philosophical level. There is no conflict between the practical and the moral.
