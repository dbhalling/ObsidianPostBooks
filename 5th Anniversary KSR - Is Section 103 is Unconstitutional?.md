The 5th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s _KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex, Inc_., 550 U.S. 398 (2007) decision is on April 30th. This is a good time to review the implications of this case, but an even better time to look into the origins and constitutionality of the Nonobviosness requirement. You might object that the jurisprudence of the nonobiviousness requirement is so well established that nothing can be learned from this sort of analysis. I disagree. Patent law is under assault by the Supreme Court, the media, the ‘information wants to free’ crowd, multinational corporations, and the economics profession. If we attempt to explain patent law based on the decisions of people who never passed the patent bar, never wrote a patent, never prosecuted a patent, and do not have a technical background – most of whom could not pass engineering physics or Calc III we are doomed. We need to define patent law as a natural law based on certain fundamental truths. This is the only way to get the non-patent attorney judge or the general public to understand patent law and understand that it represents justice. It is also why many of my comments and posts appear repetitive. For a list of the fundamental principles of patent law please see ???????????????????????????????.

  

Holding in KSR

The holding in KSR was confused, but is generally accepted as stating that the teaching, suggestion, motivation rule (TSM rule) is not the only rule of determining if an invention is obvious. What other standards the courts and the PTO should use was somewhat nebulous, but clearly the three prong test of _Graham v. John Deere Co_., 383 U.S. 1 (1966) is still valid. In addition, the Supreme Court seemed to adopted the ‘I know it when I see it’ standard to obviousness. The decision overturned the relatively objective TSM test for a subjective non-test.

  

Practical Results of KSR

I am not a litigator, but my impression is that the KSR decision has increased the uncertainty of the obviousness decision at trial and increased the complexity of presenting and defending obviousness. Despite this, I think that the CAFC has put KSR in a fairly small box (Eric Guttag could probably give a multi-hour presentation on this point).

From a prosecution point of view KSR has had less impact than David Kappos taking over from Jon Dudas and John Doll. The John’s unchecked, rogue policy of ‘rejection equals quality’ almost shut down the patent office for all but the largest multinational companies. KSR requires patent prosecutors to state the benefits of their technology in more detail in the specification, write more of the specification into the claims, and file more replies/appeals. Certain areas of technology are still persona non grata at the PTO. For instance, computer technology directed to financial transactions, high level computer programs, and so called business methods.

  

History of Non-Obviousness

The generally agreed beginning of section 103 is the Supreme Court case of _Hotchkiss v. Greenwood,_ 52 U.S. (11 How.) 248 (1851). This case first articulated the idea that an improvement that was the subject of a patent had to be more than “the work of the skilful mechanic.” The case involved making door and other knobs of all kinds of clay used in pottery, and of porcelain. The Supreme Court decision made the common error of pointing out that each of the elements in the invention were known.

  

_But in the case before us, the knob is not new, nor the metallic shank and spindle, nor the dovetail form of the cavity in the knob, nor the means by which the metallic shank is securely fastened therein. All these were well known, and in common use, and the only thing new is the substitution of a knob of a different material from that heretofore used in connection with this arrangement._

  

By the way this is one of those fundamental truths of patent law.

Every invention in the history of the world is a combination of known elements/steps

The reason for this is Conservation of Matter and Energy – you cannot create something from nothing. This idea is implicit in 35 USC 112, which requires the inventor explain their invention so that one skilled in the art can practice the invention.

Back to Hotchkiss, this ruling states the well known idea that for an invention to be patentable, it must be more than just the work of a skillful mechanic. Today this is stated as the invention must have taken more than just the work of “one skilled in the art.” Note that Justice Woodberry dissent in the Hotchkiss case argued that statute only required the invention be new and did not say anything about the work of a skillful mechanic. For a very interesting discussion of the history of the nonobviousness requirement see Novelty and the Hotchkiss Standard [http://www.law.gwu.edu/Academics/FocusAreas/IP/Documents/Novelty%20and%20the%20Hotchkiss%20Standard.pdf](http://www.law.gwu.edu/Academics/FocusAreas/IP/Documents/Novelty%20and%20the%20Hotchkiss%20Standard.pdf).

Was there any justification in the statue for the Supreme Court’s ruling in Hotchkiss? The 1790 patent act stated that the Patent Board only grant a patent if the invention was “sufficiently useful and important.” [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Act_of_1790#cite_note-kolitch-4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Act_of_1790#cite_note-kolitch-4) The patent statute of 1836, which patent attorney Darin Gibby posits in his book was based on the Venice Patent Statue [http://www.amazon.com/Why-Has-America-Stopped-Inventing/dp/1614480486/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1325296898&sr=1-1](http://www.amazon.com/Why-Has-America-Stopped-Inventing/dp/1614480486/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1325296898&sr=1-1), also contained a clause that said the Patent Office could deny a patent to an invention the Commissioner deemed the invention to be “insufficiently useful and important.” However, it appears that this part of the statue was almost never invoked. Despite this, the statute did not give this power to the Supreme Court or any other Court. As a result, Hotchkiss was a clear case of judicial activism. The Court just made up a requirement that was not in the statute and could not be considered just an interpretation of the statute.

  

Is Section 103 Constitutional?

The Constitution states at Article I, Section 8, Clause 8:

To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors **the exclusive Right** to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

The drafters of the Constitution only defined ONE RIGHT in the Constitution and that was the Right of inventors and authors. When the founders talked about ‘the right’ they meant a Natural Right. A natural right is a right that exists, whether government exists or not – of course enforcing that right is another story, which is why governments are instituted among men see Declaration of Independence. [http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/freedom/doi/text.html](http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/freedom/doi/text.html).

If the Constitution says that inventors have a right in their discoveries the first question is what is an invention? Some people have suggested that an ‘invention’ can be anything that Congress decides it is. But this is clearly nonsense. If that were the case then Constitution be meaningless. This is not ‘Alice and Wonderland’ words have meaning. So what is an invention? Inventions belong to the genus or class of human creations. However, not all human creations are inventions. For instance, a painting or a musical score is a human creation, but it is not an invention. Reproduction or making another copy of something is not invention and not a creation in the sense use herein.

We need to differentiate inventions from other human creations. Inventions belong to the species of human creations that have an objective result. What do I mean by an objective result? Examples will probably be the best way to examine this. A painting is a human creation, but it is not an invention. A painting has a subjective result – namely the viewer’s reaction. Logically, all human creations either have an objective or a subjective result or goal, there is no other choice. This point can appear confusing with respect to mathematics. Does a Fourier Transform have an objective result? For patent attorney the requirement is commonly referred to as ‘useful’ under 101. The synthesis of a new chemical is not patentable if the inventor cannot describe a practical use (industrial applicability) for the chemical. The same is true of mathematical formula.

Since the right of inventors is a natural right, Congress and Supreme Court do not have the choice to protect inventor’s rights. The Supreme Court cannot violate the Constitution, so it must strike down any legislation that contradicts with the Constitution. An invention is something created by humans that solves an objective problem. However, a patent can only issue for an invention that is new. You cannot get a patent on an invention, even if you are the inventor if you did not secure you rights within a reasonable period of time. In other words, to obtain a patent you have to be the first inventor and you cannot have waited too long. Does this make sense under the Constitution? Yes, because a failure to assert your right, even with land, eventually result in the loss of your right. As a result, there is a NOVELTY requirement for obtaining a patent. However, there is nothing about

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

This latter phrase was identical to that which had appeared in the 1790 Act,

66

and it

potentially vested a great deal of discretion in the Patent Office. It has been aptly pointed out that

its inclusion in the 1836 created a “strange admixture of concepts,” one being that the applicant

was entitled to a patent if the statutory requirements were met, and another being the

simultaneously existing power of the Commissioner to withhold the patent if he deemed the

invention to be “insufficiently useful and important.”

67

It would remain in the patent statute until

1952, although there is nothing to indicate that the Office ever made any actual effort to reject

applications on the ground that the subject matter of the invention was not sufficiently useful and

important to warrant a patent.

68

Nor is there any indication that the Office ever attempted to

promulgate rules for determining when an invention met this criterion.

  

  

Yet in 1876 in Reckendorfer v. Faber

69

the Supreme Court in discussing this language as it

appeared in the 1836 Act seemed to suggest that it authorized the Commissioner to impose a

requirement for patentability separate and distinct from the utility and novelty requirements set

forth in the 1836 Act.

70

The Court began its analysis by pointing out that under the 1836 Act “no

one is entitled to a patent unless (1) he has discovered or invented an art, machine or manufacture;

(2) which art, machine or manufacture is new; (3) which is also useful; [and] (4) which is not

known or patented as therein mentioned.”

71

But said the Court these requirements alone are not

sufficient for a patent to issue. The Commissioner must also be satisfied that the invention “is

sufficiently useful and sufficiently important to justify him in investing it with the prima facie

respect arising from the governmental approval.”
