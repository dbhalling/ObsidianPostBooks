he AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) have been running advertisements suggesting that private citizens are not able to afford things because they are spending too much.

What about a federal government that spends eleven dollars for every seven dollars it collects in taxes?

What about a federal government that has expanded its spending to over 25% of GDP from less than 19% in 2000?

What about the fact that median household income per year has fallen over $4000.00 since 2008?

What about the increasing costs for the average family, which include increasing cost of food, gas, increasing health insurance costs and particularly taxes?

The Federal Reserve is now printing/counterfeiting money – oops I mean buying over 50% of the US debt offering, but is the AICPA worried about this?

  

Speaking of PIGS – what about the Sarbanes Oxley that has made the accounting profession a fortune, when average Americans’ income was declining.

  

Is the AICPA complaining about government spending?

Is it trying to rationalize our accounting and securities laws?

  

The ACCOUNTING PROFESSION is in bed with BIG GOVERNMENT and is STEALING from the average American. The Feed the Pig Commercials are a joke, but not the kind you laugh at.
