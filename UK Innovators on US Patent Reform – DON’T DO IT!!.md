In an open letter, dated May 5, 2011, to the Prime Minister (UK) from the National SME (Small Manufacturing Entity?) Innovation Alliance.

_The patent system is effectively broken so far as SMEs are concerned. The UKIPO (United Kingdom Intellectual Property Organization) and the Minister for Intellectual Property, on the other hand, suggest instead that most SMEs do not know how to protect their innovation. Most know only too well the failure of the patent system and have given up. The reality is that the UK offers no effective means of patent enforcement for SMEs in the home market and thus no cash to seek further enforcement abroad. Patents do not do what the UKIPO claims when it sells them, which is to offer ‘protection’. We live in hope that the current IP review will reflect our reported concerns, but the way in which this review was set up does not fill us with confidence, as we have made clear to Baroness Wilcox and the Chairman of the review panel. Of course the big companies, who are the only businesses represented on the panel, like the system just the way it is: and that tells its own story._

  
  

Congress here in the US s also only interested in the opinions of large corporations when it comes to the America Invents Act. This Act will result in the U.S. having an even worse patent system for technology start-ups than the UK. This will effectively end innovation in the USA.

  
  

The next section of the letter is interesting “_The universities have also sold a false prospectus to Whitehall: HM Treasury and UKIPO data confirm that they are not the source of most new technology in the UK. It comes from the SME high technology sector, our membership.”_ This same arrogance that the education system (Universities) and government funding agencies are the source of inventions prevails here in the US. An efficiently run patent system that effectively protects the inventions of start-ups and individual inventors is the real source of technological progress. The SBA (Small Business Administration) has shown that the majority of emerging technologies are created by start-ups and individual inventors.
