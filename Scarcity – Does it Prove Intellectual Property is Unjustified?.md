A number of scholars[1](#sdfootnote1sym) have suggested that the logical basis for tangible property rights is scarcity. Property rights efficiently allocate these resources and avoid conflicts between competing rights of individuals. These scholars argue that ideas and invention are not subject to scarcity and therefore intellectual property rights should not exist. These arguments seem to be particularly prevalent among Libertarians, including the Cato Institute and Von Mises Institute, and the open source community.

Tangible property rights includes real property rights in land and buildings and personal property rights in things like cars and furniture. Tangible or physical property is scarce since it can only be owned by one person at a time and it takes resources to create it. Intangible or intellectual property such as patents and trademarks, and software in the case of the open source community, is not scarce and can be owned by multiple people without excluding another for the property. According to Tom G. Palmer:

  

It is this scarcity that gives rise to property rights.

Intellectual property rights, however, do not rest on a natural

scarcity of goods, but on an “artificial, self created scarcity.”[2](#sdfootnote2sym)

  

Scarcity is not the historical or logical basis of private property rights. The historical justification of property rights are based on the right that a person owns himself. If you do not own yourself, you are a slave. If you own yourself then you own the fruits of your labor, physical and mental. This is commonly referred to the “natural rights labor theory of property.”

In the pre-capitalist eras, private property existed de facto, but not de jure, _i.e._, by custom and sufferance, not by right or by law. In law and in principle, all property belonged to the head of the tribe, the king, and was held only by his permission, which could be revoked at any time, at his pleasure. (The king could and did expropriate the estates of recalcitrant noblemen throughout the course of Europe’s history.)[3](#sdfootnote3sym)

  

  

The labor theory of property provided the foundation of property rights as opposed to property as a custom. As a result, the scholars who suggest that property rights are based on scarcity are incorrect historically.

Despite this historical inaccuracy, perhaps “scarcity” is a better theoretical framework for the justification of property rights. The natural rights labor theory of property explains why slavery is immoral. If you own yourself, then no one else has the right to own you. It also explains why murder and manslaughter are immoral, why stealing is immoral, why assault and battery are immoral and why we have laws against all these actions. The natural rights labor theory defines how property should be allocated and how people come into possession of property morally and legally. The labor theory explains all of our basic criminal law and all of our basic property laws. What does scarcity explain? It offers no justification for why slavery, murder, manslaughter, assault and batter and theft are immoral, except that they are inefficient at allocating resources. Thus, all of these crimes would be allowed if they were efficient at allocating resources. Scarcity does not explain who has ownership in property or why they should have ownership in property. It merely explains that private property ownership is an efficient manner in allocating scarce resources.

In science, the theory that has the greatest ability to explain the widest number of facts is considered to be the correct or better theory. Here the “scarcity” theory of private property requires the additional assumption that it is preferable to have efficient allocation of resources. However, it fails to explain how the resource should be initially distributed, it does not explain how property law determines ownership and has no power to explain criminal law. Trading scarcity for the labor theory of property is like trading the theory that “what goes up must come down” for Newton’s Law of gravity. The fact of the matter is that the proponents of scarcity have confused cause with effect. A system of private property results in efficient allocation of resource, but it is not the reason for private property – it is the effect of private property.

  

  

Scarcity and Intellectual Property: Empirical Evidence for Inventions

  

A number of scholars[4](#sdfootnote4sym) have suggested that the logical basis for property rights is scarcity. Property rights efficiently allocate these resources and avoid conflicts. These scholars argue that ideas and inventions are not subject to scarcity and therefore intellectual property rights should not exist. These arguments seem to be particularly prevalent among Libertarians, including the Cato Institute and Von Mises Institute, and the open source community.

In this article we will examine whether there is a lack of scarcity in the creation of ideas.

Tangible property rights include real property rights in land and buildings and personal property rights in things like cars and furniture. Tangible or physical property is scarce since it can only be owned by one person at a time and it takes resources to create. Intangible or intellectual property such as patents and copyrights, and software in the case of the open source community, is not scarce according to this theory. Multiple people may own intellectual property without excluding others from the property. According to Tom G. Palmer a proponent of the scarcity theory of property:

  

It is this scarcity that gives rise to property rights.

Intellectual property rights, however, do not rest on a natural

scarcity of goods, but on an “artificial, self created scarcity.”[5](#sdfootnote5sym)

  

Patents, one of the types of intellectual property rights, are based on creating new ideas or inventions. The number of potential inventions appears to be almost limitless. For instance, Paul Romer, a professor of economics at Stanford states:

  

On any conceivable horizon -- I'll say until about 5 billion years from now, when the sun explodes -- we're not going to run out of discoveries. Just ask how many things we could make by taking the elements from the periodic table and mixing them together. There's a simple mathematical calculation: It's 10 followed by 30 zeros. In contrast, 10 followed by 19 zeros is about how much time has elapsed since the universe was created.[6](#sdfootnote6sym)

  

Someone might object that Paul Romer has overstated the number of possible chemical inventions, since not all elements are able to chemically bind to each other. On the other hand, this calculation only includes one of each element. Some of our most important chemical compounds contain long chains of carbon and silicon atoms. In addition, the elements can bond to each other in multiple ways, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. Elements may also have double, triple and quadruple bonds. When you add in all these variations, Dr. Romer probably underestimated the number of possible chemical inventions. This calculation is only for chemistry. When you consider computer networks or electronic circuits with millions of transistors or nodes the number of different possible connection is n(n-1)/2 or easily equal to the number of combinations described for chemistry. This does not begin to name all the possible number of inventions. This would seem to argue for a lack of scarcity on the conception of ideas or inventions.

Although there are unlimited number of potential inventions, this does not mean that creating them free. The U.S. spends over $300 billion a year on research and development to discover inventions.[7](#sdfootnote7sym) Either the U.S. government and numerous high technology companies are wasting a tremendous amount of money on a fraud, or the conception of inventions is subject to scarcity. Just like real property conceiving inventions takes scarce resources. The number of researchers, research facilities, and research equipment are all subject to scarcity. Each researcher’s ability to pursue various inventions and discoveries is limited. Clearly, the proponents of the scarcity theory of property are incorrect that the development of inventions and innovations is not subject scarcity.

Scarcity and Intellectual Property: Empirical Evidence of Adoption of Technology

  

A number of scholars[8](#sdfootnote8sym) have suggested that the logical basis for property rights is scarcity. Property rights efficiently allocate these resources and avoid conflicts.

These arguments seem to be particularly prevalent among Libertarians, including the Cato Institute and Von Mises Institute, and the open source community.

In this article we will examine whether there is a lack of scarcity in the adoption and distribution of new technology.

_**Property Rights**_

The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is their only implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are possible. Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave.

Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right _to an object_, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man _will_ earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.

If some men are entitled _by right_ to the products of the work of others, it means that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slave labor.

The institution of private property, in the full, legal meaning of the term, was brought into existence only by capitalism. In the pre-capitalist eras, private property existed de facto, but not de jure, _i.e._, by custom and sufferance, not by right or by law. In law and in principle, all property belonged to the head of the tribe, the king, and was held only by his permission, which could be revoked at any time, at his pleasure. (The king could and did expropriate the estates of recalcitrant noblemen throughout the course of Europe’s history.)
