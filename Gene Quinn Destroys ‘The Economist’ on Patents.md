The Economist has printed another of their fantasy articles on patents entitled “[A question of utility](http://www.economist.com/node/21660559).” Gene Quinn has written a great article showing the numerous inaccuracies in The Economist’s article entitled “[What ‘The Economist’ Doesn’t Get about Patents](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/08/13/what-the-economist-doesnt-get-about-patents/id=60626/#comment-2705096).” The Economist article argues that patents were irrelevant to the industrial revolution. Mr. Quinn shows the fallacy of this statement, but I want to amplify on what he said. The industrial revolution started in England and the United States, which were the two countries with functioning patent systems. The industrial revolution was not about industry but about a continuous invention revolution as the book “[The Most Powerful Idea in the World](http://www.amazon.com/Most-Powerful-Idea-World-Invention-ebook/dp/B0036S49WS/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1440524578&sr=1-1&keywords=the+most+powerful+idea+in+the+world)” illustrates. Modern ‘New Growth Economics’ has shown that the only way to increase real per capita incomes, is to increase our level of technology and that means creating new inventions.

My new book [Source of Economic Growth](http://www.amazon.com/Source-Economic-Growth-Dale-Halling-ebook/dp/B00XDAG22E/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1440524961&sr=1-1&keywords=Source+of+economic+growth) tackles these important questions specifically it answers these two questions: 1) What is the source of real per captia increases in wealth? And 2) What was the cause of the industrial revolution? I provide overwhelming evidence that new inventions are the only way to increase real per capita incomes and property rights for inventions, i.e., patents, are the only way to provide a high enough level of inventing to escape the Malthusian Trap and enter the Industrial Revolution.
