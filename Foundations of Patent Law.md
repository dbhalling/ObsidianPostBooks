Below in no particular order are some of the foundational rules of patent law. No attempt is made to prove these rules, but most should be familiar to patent attorneys. If you disagree or are looking for an explanation feel free to comment below and I will respond. In many cases I have already written a post related to the foundational rules. For my analysis of the Foundation of 35 USC 103 see 5th Anniversary of KSR: Is Section 103 is Unconstitutional? [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/04/30/ksr-103-unconstitutional/id=24471/](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/04/30/ksr-103-unconstitutional/id=24471/)

  

  

*Patents are a Constitutional Right

  

*Patents and Copyrights are the only right mention in the Constitution

  

*Patents are a Natural Right

  

*Patents are a Property Right – the basis of all property rights is creation/production and the same is true of patent.

  

*Trade Secrets are a Natural Right

  

*Patents can be viewed as a Social Contract where the inventor gives up their right to a trade secret in order to obtain a patent.

  

*All Inventions are a combination of known/existing elements/steps and connections

  

*Patents are not monopolies (A property right cannot be a monopoly)

  

*All Inventions use natural phenomena – we are not dealing in magic.

  

*Every element in every claim of a patent behaves in a predictable way – they do not violate the laws of physics – again we are not patenting magic.

  

*Claims define what the invention is.

  

*Every element (word) in a claim has to be given meaning – reading a claim is like reading an equation, not like reading prose.

  

*The definition of an Invention implies that it is Useful or has an Objective Result

  

*The definition of an inventor requires that they be the first person to create the invention, which results in the novelty requirement.
