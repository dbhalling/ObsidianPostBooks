Introduction

  

This book started as a project based on my observations. I deal with technology start-up entrepreneurs everyday as a patent attorney. I notice a difference between the sort of projects my clients were undertaking since the technology downturn of 2000-2001 and the 90s. Clients, in the 90s, would come into my office with plans to build businesses that were disruptive or revolutionary. The technologies underlying these companies held the potential to completely redefine a market. Some of these of these ideas would increase the available bandwidth by 10x for minimal costs or allow data searches that were 10-100x faster than existing technologies. It was extremely exciting talking with these entrepreneurs. Their energy was infectious and the potential implications of their work was mesmerizing. The technology downturn of 2000-2001 forced a reevaluation of these aggressive business plans. I expected that after a couple years of the technology market taking a breath, I would again be working with companies trying to change the world.

This expectation never came to fruition. The start-up companies I came into contact with were all looking for narrow niche markets. Instead of trying to change a whole area of a technology and go public, these companies were looking to develop incremental changes in technology and be bought out by an existing company. I started wondering if other people in the technology business were seeing similar trends. My informal surveys centered around the question of whether this decade (2000-2009) was as innovative as in the 90s. While I would say that most of people I surveyed felt this decade was not as innovative as the 90s, there were people who disagreed.

Some the innovations that the dissenters pointed to were the iPod, the tremendous amount of money Intel was spending to build their next microprocessor plant, and the social media industry. While these are certainly innovative, these innovations did not drive the whole economy like the Internet of the 90s. The Internet in the 90s affected almost every business in the U.S. For instance, it drove PC sales, retail, electronics, telecommunications, professional businesses, marketing, newspapers, etc. It also redefined whole areas of life, with email, online shopping, online advertising, it was impossible to escape the effects of the Internet unless you crawled under a rock. The personal computer revolution of the 80s had a similar, although somewhat less pronounced effect. The iPod is cool, but it hardly effected the whole economy, in fact it did not even drive the electronics or software business. The same can be said of Intel’s gigantic investment in a new microprocessor and social media sites.

I began to wonder about the reasons for the differences in the 90s and this decade. What were the causes and implications for these differences? Since the main difference centered around the level of innovation, I began to explore some the structural factors that effect innovation. It also caused me to explore in depth what the implications of innovation were for the U.S. economy. My quest caused me to question whether my concern about innovation was egocentric or whether there were more fundamental reasons to be concerned about America’s level of innovation. This book is the result of this inquiry.

There is no attempt in this book to have determined or exposed every cause for the decline in our innovation. I have only focused on those causes that are most critical. For instance, I do not focus on the limited number of H-1B visas. While I agree that we need to increase the number of H-1B visas, I do not think this by itself will change the U.S.’s level of innovation. FASB’s elimination of the “pooling of interests” accounting for mergers definitely hurt the technology start-up community. However, the impact was somewhat reduced by the new rules on accounting for goodwill. While I think “pooling of interests” accounting for mergers should be allowed, again I am skeptical this by itself will significantly change the level of innovation.

Each chapter in this book is intended to be self-standing. Chapters 1-8 build on each other to make a larger point about innovation and its effect on our economy. Chapter 8 ends with some recommendations to jump start the high technology start-up community and the U.S. economy. Chapter 0 sets up a number of themes examined in this book.

Chapter 0 is about the musings of a mythical Fed Chairman in the late 90s. He is concerned with the rapid rate that treasury securities are being paid off and how the Federal Reserve will control the money supply without treasury securities. This leads to questions about the causes for the incredible economic growth of the 90s. His musings take him on a journey covering the financial innovations that made the Industrial Revolution and Information Age possible. He also explores the history of technology including the anti-technology attitudes of the 70s and the business model underlying the innovation of the 90s.

Chapter 1 compares and contrasts the U.S. economy in the 90s and this decade (2000-2009). The chapter shows how far our economy has deteriorated using a variety of graphs and statistics. The recession of the 2008-2009 is likely to be the worst recession since the recession of the early 80s and may surpass it.

Chapter 2 demonstrates that U.S. innovation since 2000 has been anemic. This is in sharp contrast to the innovation of the 90s, which made the U.S. the envy of the world. From the decline in the number of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and the brain drain the U.S. experiencing to the fact that in 2008 fewer patents were issued to Americans than foreign applicants by the U.S. Patent Office, U.S. innovation is declining.

Chapter 3 discusses the three broad theories of how to stimulate economic growth: 1) spending side economics, 2) supply side economics, and 3) innovation side economics. This chapter explains that production precedes consumption and invention precedes production. It establishes that real long term per capita growth is the result of innovation.

Chapter 4 demonstrates that the U.S. economy is built on innovation. The first colony of the U.S. was only possible because of two new technologies. The U.S. has been a leader in every major technology innovation since the constitutional convention. The U.S. is wealthy because of its technological innovation, not because of its natural resources.

Chapter 5 provides a tour of the history of patent law, particularly the development of patent law in the U.S. Particular emphasis is placed on the changes in the patent laws since 2000 and how these changes affect the incentives for inventors. This chapter is longer than most of the other chapters because I found that attitudes towards patents track attitudes toward innovation, the free market and entrepreneurs. Patents are the free market process of encouraging innovation. There are many pundits pointing out that the U.S. in not innovating, but most of these pundits suggest updated versions of NASA to jump start innovation in the U.S. The evidence is clear that a strong patent system does more to encourage innovation than any NASA like program at less than 1% of the cost. A strong patent system mobilizes the private sector to focus on innovation that dwarfs any project undertaken by the government both in the quantity of innovation and resources devoted to innovation. The Internet in the 90s ably demonstrates this. While the Internet was based on a DOD project (ARPANET), it did not drive the economy of the whole world until private industry was mobilized to utilize the Internet.

Chapter 6 discusses the effect of Sarbanes Oxley on the technology start-up ecosystem. The history of financial regulation in the U.S. is explored. The effectiveness of financial regulation, including Sarbanes Oxley, is reviewed. Suggestions on how securities regulations can be amended to encourage innovation are provided.

Chapter 7 reviews the history of the accounting rules associated with employee incentive stock options. After 30 years of debating the accounting rules on stock options, FASB changed the manner in which companies account for stock options. The logic behind this rule changes is explored in the context of accounting’s role in society.

Chapter 8 provides a summary showing that the economic growth of the 90s was the result of innovation. The innovation was driven by high technology start-up companies built on intellectual capital, financial capital, and human capital. Since 2000 the U.S. has changed the rules governing each of these pillars on which the innovation of the 90s was built. Changing these laws and regulations would be inexpensive, politically uncontroversial, and reinvigorate America’s economy.

  

  

Chapter 0: Phoenix

  

The Federal Reserve Chairman was sitting in his office contemplating the fantastic problem that he and the other fed governors were trying to solve. The Federal Reserve, since its inception in 1913, had never faced such a dilemma. Huge federal budget surpluses were likely to wipe out the federal debt in the next couple of years and the fed chairman was concerned how the Federal Reserve was going to control the money supply. Buying and selling treasury notes was one of the major methods the Federal Reserve used to control the money supply. Controlling the money supply was necessary to control inflation, ease recessions and deal with banking crises, such as 1930’s style runs on banks. The Federal Reserve buys treasury bills when they want to increase the money supply and sells treasury bills when they want to decrease the money supply. If the federal deficit was paid off, then the Federal Reserve would have difficulty using open market operations to control the money supply. The Federal Reserve could still alter the discount rate or the required reserve ratio of banks to alter the money supply, but open market operations have a more immediate.

It was late in the day, and the Fed Chairman stretched and looked out the window. The sky was clear, stars were twinkling. His mind began to wander. He wondered how the U.S. ever got into this situation. Sound money policies such as those started by his predecessor and continued under his chairmanship were partly responsible. In contrast, the inflation of the 1970’s had almost bankrupted the U.S. economy by destroying people’s savings and causing them to speculate on hard assets rather than invest in productive enterprises. This resulted in the stagflation economy of the 1970s. To combat the high inflation of the 1970s his predecessor had raised interest rates until the prime rate was at 21.5%. This killed off inflationary expectations, but at a terrible cost in terms of jobs and one of the worst economic downturns since the 1930s. Sound monetary policies stimulated people to invest in productive enterprises, increased the saving rate, eliminated speculative investments in hard assets such as gold, and increased lending. The Fed Chairman congratulated himself that his policies had helped to bring about this current prosperity. Then he remembered that China in the 1970s had sound monetary policies keeping inflation under control and this by itself did not lead to strong economic growth. Clearly more than sound monetary policy was responsible.

Fiscal restraint exhibited by the federal government in the late 1990s along with the peace dividend from the fall of Soviet Union was key in reducing the federal deficit. Of course the almost 64% (about 6.0% compounded per year) increase in federal receipts from 1990-1999 also contributed significantly. The reduction in the federal deficit brought down borrowing costs for private companies, which helped to expand the private sector. This economic expansion contributed to the 64% growth in federal revenues over nine years. However, federal spending only grew 46% (about 4.3% compounded per year) over those same nine years. This was significant because a number of states and municipalities did not show the same restraint and their budgets were growing at near double-digit rates in the late 1990s. The Fed Chairman had to admit that while fiscal restraint by the government was important to economic growth; it was not the main cause. Ultimately, the private sector was responsible.

The Fed Chairman thought to himself that some people might attribute the economic growth, which was ultimately responsible for his problem of how to control the money supply, on the natural resources of the country. While the U.S. was blessed with abundant natural resources, the known natural resources of the U.S. had not changed significantly since the discovery of and exploitation of the Alaskan oil reserve.

The key to long-term economic growth and the growth of personal income, the Fed Chairman thought to himself, had to be innovation, particularly technological innovation. The technological driver of the 1990s was the digital economy, based on transistors. The digital economy was financed by venture capital. This combination of the digital economy and venture capital grew from the ashes of the 1970s economy. Then, the end of the machine and energy age gave way to the beginning of the Information Age. The pinnacle of the machine age had been the Apollo program, which pushed the limits of chemical energy sources to move machines. The Apollo program was the crowing achievement the machine age that began with the steam engine of the early 1700s. The steam engine was the first generally available replacement for human labor. There had been water wheels and windmills for years, but they were restricted to certain locations and could not generally replace human labor in all areas. The machine age had progressed from coal and steam engines to oil and internal combustion engines by the late 1800s. On the heels of internal combustion machines were electrical power and electrical motors finding wide use in factories and in the home. Eventually, electrical power allowed a wide variety of machines to be used in the home, such as refrigerators, washing machines and dryers. Houses and factories were electrically lit. Automobiles were also a product of this technological wave and the first Model T rolled off the assembly line in 1908. Mass production started before the chemically powered machine age but profited from it. During the machine age, the population of industrial countries grew faster than at any time in History and real per capita income finally started growing after two millennium of being essentially stagnancy of around $700-800 per year in Europe.

The machine age also saw a number of financial innovations that were necessary for its extraordinary economic growth. One of the most important being the beginning of modern banking. Now, this was a subject near and dear to the Fed Chairman’s heart. Modern banking started in the early 1600s with the Bank of Amsterdam. Merchants could deposit coins with the Bank of Amsterdam and use this account to pay for transactions. Using checks, a merchant’s account was debited and another merchant’s account was credited. This meant that coins did not have to be transported from one merchant to another with the attendant risk of theft and loss or the cost of transportation. The Bank of Amsterdam was just an exchange bank that facilitated transactions between merchants. Next came the Swedish Riksbank established in 1656. The Riksbank was not only an exchange bank, it also lent money making it the first modern fractional reserve bank. Fractional reserve banking is the banking practice in which banks keep only a fraction of their deposits in reserve (as cash and other highly liquid assets) and lend out the remainder, while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand. Commonly, loans are made against collateral such as land or jewelry. The Fed Chairman thought to himself that some people believed fractional reserve banking created money out of thin air, but what really happened was the money for these loans were backed by some collateral other than coins or bullion. The downside of other types of collateral is they are not as liquid as species (coins, bullion). As a result, if large numbers of customers of a fractional reserve bank wanted species (currency) at the same time, the bank would not able to fulfill all its customer’s demands. This is a classic run on a bank. A run on a bank is a cash flow issue. A sound bank may have plenty of collateral and performing loans, but if most of its customers demand species at the same time it will not be able to fulfill these requests. Fractional reserve banks free up capital from low performing assets so that they can be invested in higher performing assets. For example, if you owned a large tract of ranching land that was not highly profitable but represented a large amount of capital and you want to invest in an oil well, without fractional reserve banking you would have to sell some of the land in order to invest. With fractional reserve banking you could convert your land into a generally accepted form of money, by pledging your land as collateral to a bank for a loan. In the modern world, the loan to you is just a computer entry in your bank account.

The next great innovation in banking was the joint stock company. The Bank of England was permitted to be a joint stock company starting in 1709. This allowed the Bank of England to sell shares in the Bank to raise capital. The advent of modern banking allowed for efficient transfer of money between parties without which the machine age would have been impossible. It also allowed unproductive capital from the agricultural economy to be converted into standard currency which in turn was invested in more productive machine age enterprises.

The joint stock limited liability company was a key innovation of the machine age. These types of companies allow people to pool their resources taking on ventures that an individual investor wouldn’t have the money to capitalize on. In addition, the investors’ liability is limited to only the money they invested. As a result, investors do not have to worry that if the company fails they will become bankrupt. The first joint stock limited liability corporations were formed to run banks and to exploit the new maritime technologies that allowed spices and other goods to be transported to Europe for significantly less money than overland routes. It is often the case, the Fed Chairman mused, that advances in technology require advances in finance in order to fulfill their potential. That is the case with banks and joint stock limited liability companies. Financial and legal innovations were necessary to capitalize on the advances in maritime technology, also playing a critical role in advancing the machine age.

By the 1970s, the machine age seemed to have played out. The romantic notions that everyone would be flying around like the Jetsons and have robots at their command, just seemed to fizzle out in the 1970s. The private airplane market that held such promise in the 1960s was almost dead by the end of the 1970s, because of the cost of litigation. The dream of supersonic airliners, only partially fulfilled by the European Concord, became too expensive. The promise of cheap energy from nuclear power was killed off by regulations that created a number of white elephant nuclear projects. The U.S. seemed to be losing its technological edge to the Japanese, as Americans’ switched from Detroit’s automobiles to Japanese automobiles. The U.S. went from an oil producing country to an oil importing country. Out of the economic ashes of the 1970s, an embryonic version of the digital age was being created in Silicon Valley. The microprocessor was invented in the early 1970s and it was the key to the new digital information economy that would make the U.S. the economic powerhouse of the world in the 1990s. In order for the digital information economy to fulfill its promise, it would need a new financial model. That financial model was venture capital financing. The way this model worked is a bright engineer or scientist came up with an innovation to further the digital information economy. He formed a company with other bright engineers who shared the equity. The company started working on the innovation, securing rights to the innovation by applying for patents, and applying to a venture capital company for financing. Once venture capital financing was secured, management talent was lured away from large stable companies by offering a combination of a lower salary with stock options in the company. If the company was successful, it either has an initial public offering, or was bought out by a larger technology company with similar goals. This provided a liquidity event for the venture capital firm so that the investors in the venture capital firm could be paid. The founders and management talent cashed in their stock or stock options and realized a financial reward for their innovation and risk taking. Commonly, the founders and management started new companies or funded others in the digital information space. This model was honed by the 1990s and drove unprecedented growth in technological innovation, resulting in the wealth that now was paying down the federal debt at a tremendous clip. While not all high technology start-ups used this model, all high technology companies used parts of this model and benefited from the model. It was clear to the Fed Chairman that the blame for the problem of how to control the money supply lay with the growth caused by the digital information economy.

He marveled at the resiliency of the U.S. economy to hatch the phoenix of the digital information economy from the ashes of the 1970s economy. Suddenly he had a sinking feeling in his stomach. He wondered if by identifying the engine of growth, had he doomed it to additional regulations and taxes effectively stifling its innovation? Commonly, politicians seize upon any new area of economic growth to raise additional revenue. For instance, all the state governments had wanted to tax the Internet as soon as it became an economic force. Politicians also have a tendency to start adding regulations on any industry that becomes too successful. A pundit once said of American government that it taxes and regulates any business that is profitable until it becomes unprofitable, and then it subsidizes it. The Fed Chairman stretched and yawned. Outside, large raindrops pelted against the windows.

Chapter 1 It’s the Economy Stupid

  

The tremendous economic growth of the 90s was built upon the innovation of the Information Age. The companies that drove this growth were built on intellectual capital, financial capital, and human capital. In chapters 5, 6 & 7 we will show how changes to our laws and regulations undermined these three pillars.

So successful was the innovation of the 90s that it was close to paying off the national debt in 1999. However by August of 2009 the federal debt level had grown to $11 trillion dollars. The unemployment rate was 9.7% - the second highest level since the Great Depression. The maximum exposure for the bailouts to the U.S. government was just under $24 trillion. There were 2.3 million homes in foreclosure proceedings in the first nine months of 2009.

  

Unemployment

The unadjusted unemployment rate in August of 2009 hit 9.7%. The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank has predicted that the unemployment rate may top out at over 11%. If so it will result in the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.

  

[![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375755y_tmp_276b566f70c75cb2.png)](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?s%5B1%5D%5Bid%5D=UNRATE)

The stated unemployment rate probably understates the entire magnitude of the problem. There are considerably more self employed people today than 30 years ago and self employed people do not collect unemployment compensation. As a result, they are not counted as unemployed. Many self employed people are also under-employed meaning that their business has dropped off considerably. When you take this into account, it is possible that the unemployment rate exceeds 10%.

During most of the 90s the unemployment rate was below 6% and at the height of the technology boom, the employment rate fell below 4%, a rate not seen since the 60s. The 80s and 90s were decades of declining unemployment. Economist, now predict it will take years for the U.S. to regain the jobs that are lost during this recession.

  

Industrial Production

As the chart on industrial production below shows, the recession of 2008 & 2009 is extremely severe. With the government take over of General Motors, proposals to raise taxes, and innovation killing regulations such as Sarbanes Oxley, it is likely that there will be further erosion of the industrial sector.

  

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375755y_tmp_25c968deb5412c56.png)

The chart also shows that industrial production in the 90s grew faster and more than it every did during the 2000-2009 decade. The innovation of the 90s resulted in a greater than 42% increase in the industrial production index. Even during the growth period between 2000-2009, the index only grew less than 20%. All the progress in this decade has been reversed in less than a year. Clearly, the economic growth of this decade was thin and weak, while the growth of the 90s was deep and robust. The economy of the 2000-2009 decade centered around the housing market, while the growth of the 90s revolved around technological innovation. This is a major factor for the different outcomes in these two decades, as will be explained in more detail in chapter 3.

  

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

The first chart (Quarter-to-Quarter Growth in Real GDP) below shows the sharp decline in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2008 and 2009. A decline of this magnitude has not be seen since the severe recession in the early 80s. Because of the record deficits we have incurred, it is unlikely that the U.S. economy will not resume strong economic growth for sometime.

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375755y_tmp_7e6eb1181d17eb6d.png)

U.S. Federal Budget Surplus/Deficit

The Federal Budget Surplus/Deficit chart below shows that in the late 90s there was a budget surplus. Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, believed these budget surpluses might payoff the federal debt. This hope was quickly erased by the budget deficits of the Bush administration. However, as the chart shows the budget deficit exploded in 2009. These budget deficits are likely to cause inflation and be a drag on the economy for years to come.

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375755y_tmp_fd985e3611043a59.png)

The total U.S. federal debt in August of 2009 is over $11 trillion dollars. Note that these budget deficit numbers are computed on a cash basis. If the unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare were included, these numbers would be much larger. For instance, if Social Security had to use the same accounting system as an insurance company, its unfunded liabilities would be around $8.5 trillion. The unfunded liabilities of Medicare are around $74 trillion as of 2009. With the first baby boomers turning 65 in 2010, these unfunded liabilities are a huge concern. The unfunded liabilities are likely to become a significant drag on the U.S. economy in the next decade.

Given the stark differences in the performance of the U.S. economy in 80s and 90s and its performance since then, it begs the question what changed? We know that the economy of the 90s was characterized by technological innovation, a growing stock market, and numerous start-up companies. The economy of the 2000-2009 decade was dominated by the housing sector, easy credit, and few technology start-ups. Why did the innovation of the 90s not continue into this decade? Why was there a sudden decrease in the number of start-up companies? Are these differences important in the economic outcomes of these two decades?

This book endeavors to demonstrate that innovation is critical for real, long term increases in GDP and per capita income – see chapters 3 & 4. Little known changes in our laws and regulations have strangled the entrepreneurial companies, which drove the growth of the 90s. These entrepreneurial companies were built on the foundations of intellectual capital, financial capital, and human capital. Since 2000 the U.S. has enacted laws and regulations, which have undermined all three of these foundations of the entrepreneurial start-ups of the 90s. These little known changes are the source of the malaise in the American economy today.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Chapter 2 U.S. Technological Stagnation

  

There are number of indications that the U.S. is losing its technological edge. In the second quarter of 2008, there were no public offerings of Silicon Valley venture capital-backed companies, a phenomenon not seen since 1978. U.S. venture capital firms are investing more of their funds overseas. Many U.S. trained, foreign national, scientists and engineers are leaving the U.S. and returning to their home countries. In 2001 (the most recent year for which data are available), US industry spent more on tort litigation than on research.[1](#sdfootnote1sym)

A strong start-up technology sector results in a large number of Initial Public Offerings. The chart below shows the incredible number of IPOs that occurred in the 90s and the relative dearth of IPOs since 2000. This is a strong indicator that the U.S. has not been as innovative in the 2000-2009 decade as in the 90s.

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375755y_tmp_f0bf712b08e3928f.png)

According to John Kao, an innovation expert from Harvard,

  

One of the most stunning migrations of the past decade . . . has been the U.S. venture capital’s move overseas. The source of such a large share of the funding for innovation is finding its way to China and India in ever greater amounts. In 2006 alone, U.S. venture funds invested $856 million in 71 deals in India and $1.1 billion in 105 deals in China.

  

This is a clear sign of no confidence in the U.S. While it is true that technological innovation is spreading throughout the world, venture capital funds traditionally loath investing far from their home base. The extra cost and time of travel to oversee their investments and the reduced insight into distant investments have usually driven venture capital firms to invest within a days car travel of their home base.

The U.S. is now ranked eighth in the Global Innovation Index, behind Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Iceland, Ireland, Hong Kong and Finland. The Global Innovation Index is produced by The Boston Consulting Group and the National Association of Manufacturing. It is a good thing that other countries are becoming more innovative. It is a bad thing if the U.S. falling behind in the innovation rankings because it is becoming less innovative. In this case, it is clear that the U.S. has been falling behind in innovation since 2000.

There is increasing evidence that the U.S. is experiencing a brain drain. Thirty thousand Indian born technology professionals returned home in 2005 & 2006.[2](#sdfootnote2sym) U.S. scientists and engineers are being lured away to other countries by better opportunities and equipment. “Edison Liu, former head of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and now a division head at Singapore’s Biopolis, the country’s massive new research center aimed vaulting Singapore to biotech preeminence.”[3](#sdfootnote3sym)

The National Academy of Sciences in 2007 was tasked with reviewing America’s competitive position on science and technology. Some of interesting highlights are provided below

The United States is today a net importer of _high-technology_ products. Its trade balance in high-technology manufactured goods shifted from _plus_ $54 billion in 1990 to _negative_ $50 billion in 2001.[4](#sdfootnote4sym)

In 2005, only four American companies ranked among the top 10 corporate recipients of patents granted by the _United States_ Patent and Trademark Office.[5](#sdfootnote5sym)

In South Korea, 38% of all undergraduates receive their degrees in

natural science or engineering. In France, the figure is 47%, in China, 50%,

and in Singapore, 67%. In the United States, the corresponding figure is

15%.

Some 34% of doctoral degrees in natural sciences (including

the physical, biological, earth, ocean, and atmospheric sciences) and

56% of engineering PhDs in the United States are awarded to foreign-born

students.

In the US science and technology workforce in 2000, 38% of PhDs

were foreign-born.

Estimates of the number of engineers, computer scientists, and

information-technology students who obtain 2-, 3-, or 4-year degrees vary.

One estimate is that in 2004, China graduated about 350,000 engineers,

computer scientists, and information technologists with 4-year degrees,

while the United States graduated about 140,000. China also graduated

about 290,000 with 3-year degrees in these same fields, while the US graduated

about 85,000 with 2- or 3-year degrees. Over the past 3 years alone,

both China and India have doubled their production of 3- and 4-year

degrees in these fields, while the United States production of engineers is

stagnant and the rate of production of computer scientists and information

technologists doubled.

About one-third of US students intending to major in engineering

switch majors before graduating.

The proportion of bachelor’s degrees in physics to total degrees

More S&P 500 CEOs obtained their undergraduate degrees in engineering

This report clearly demonstrates that the U.S. is losing it technological competitiveness. Venture capital is moving overseas. U.S. and foreign born engineers and scientists in the U.S. are moving overseas for better opportunities. Almost half of all the patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office were to non-U.S. inventors. The number of patents issued to U.S. based inventors declined in 2008, while the number of U.S. patents issued to foreign based inventors increased in 2008.

  

  

Chapter 3: The Holy Grail of Economic Growth, Productivity, and Income

  

  

Traditional Explanation of Economic Growth

What causes economic growth? One of the common explanations is consumer spending.

As a headline on Minnesota Public Radio’s website in October 30, 2008 stated “Consumer Spending Accounts for Two-Thirds of U.S. Economy.” If consumer spending is such a big part of the economy, then all that is necessary to stimulate economic growth is to get consumers spending more. The other one-third of the U.S. economy is government spending, so perhaps by having the government spend more money we can stimulate the economy. The theory of spending causing economic growth is commonly associated with Keynesian economics.

The multiplier effect is one of the more bizarre theories of consumption side economics. The multiplier effect states that for each dollar of government spending, the private economy will spend three dollars. More recent estimates are 1.2 to 1.5 depending on the type of spending. One implication of this theory is if we want ten percent growth in the economy, the government just needs to spend enough money so the multiplier results in a 10% increase in the economy. Therefore, if we want infinite growth, then the government just needs to spend an infinite amount of money.

Say’s Law of classical economics states that production creates its own demand. Modern economists building on Say’s Law propose policies that encourage production. As a result, they focus on low taxes, minimal government spending and incentives for companies and people to produce economic growth. This school of thought focuses on the supply/production side of the economy. A major tenet of supply side economics is the Laffer Curve. The Laffer curve shows that when the marginal tax rate is too high it actually results in less tax revenue than a lower tax rate. As a result, high marginal tax rates are often counter productive.

Logically, supply side economics has a significant advantage over Keynesian economics because it is consistent with the reality of consumption and production. In order to consume something, first one has to produce. Imagine a self-sufficient corn farmer who consumes all his corn including his seed stock. He has maximized his consumption, which should be good, according to Keynesian economics, but he has nothing to grow next year and will starve unless he finds another means to produce food.

  

Adam Smith and Growth

Adam Smith suggested three ways in which the annual output of a country could be increased.[6](#sdfootnote6sym) One is an increase the population, second is the division of labor and third is “some addition and improvement to those machines and instruments which facilitate and abridge labor.”[7](#sdfootnote7sym) An increase in the population or number of workers will increase the output of a nation but does not result in per capita economic growth. This chapter is concerned with what causes per capita economic growth, which improves the life of the average person. Why would the division of labor result in growth? When each person focuses on their particular job, they are able to produce efficiencies that are unlikely to occur when they are a jack-of-all-trades. Interestingly, our income tax discourages the division of labor. Because of the income tax, many people will take on tasks in their personal lives that theoretically would be more economically performed by another person. For instance, a homeowner might repair their washing machine rather than hire a repairman. The after tax cost of hiring the repairman is more than they earn per hour. Without income taxes, it would make more sense for the homeowner to hire the repairman and focus on their own profession. However, there are limits to how efficient people can be in their jobs. Finally, Adam Smith suggests an increase in capital goods and inventions will increase a nation output.

  

Innovation Economics

Modern economists have studied this issue and found that increases in capital goods are not nearly as likely to result in economic growth as innovation.[8](#sdfootnote8sym) Robert Solow won the Nobel Prize in Economics because of his work on the causes of economic growth. His model suggests that fourth fifths of the economic growth of the U.S. is the result of technological progress.

Real per capita increases in income can only be the result of innovation. Adding capital without any innovation associated with the capital will result in elevating every worker to a certain efficiency level, however never above that level. Once every worker has the all the capital resources they can use in their job they have hit a maximum output without innovation.

What if we had exactly the same technology now as we did in 1800? Would we be any better off per capita than the people of 1800? You might think that we would live longer. But, why would we live longer. We would have the same nutrition, sanitation, and medicine as them. We would have no advantages over our ancestors if we were limited to their technology. Our per capita income would be the same as the people of the 1800s.

Real per capita income growth is due to innovation. This is consistent with classical economics and supply side economics but refines our understanding of growth. The sad thing is, most college economics courses do not even discuss innovation. These courses focus on static supply and demand curves. Covering up the discussion of innovation with the Latin phrase “ceteris paribus” – all other things being equal.

The process of innovation, which Joseph Schumpeter called creative destruction, has largely been ignored by economics. However, other economists who have worked on innovation economics, include Robert Solow, Paul Romer and Gregory Clark. From a fundamental point of view in order to consume something it first has to be produced. In order to produce something, it first has to be invented or discovered.

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375755y_tmp_ce3f7b983c4f5782.jpg)

While inventions are the cause of per capita income growth, market feedback mechanisms are still necessary to determine what inventions should receive investment. Without market feedback mechanisms, we might end up in the same position as the USSR. They setout on a program to produce more steel than countries in the west and succeeded in the 1950s. This caused many pundits in the west to suggest that communism was economically superior to western capitalism. However, it turned out that much of the steel was not needed and therefore not production but waste.

The U.S. needs to adopt policies that encourage innovation. However, these policies should be structured to work within our market economy. Encouraging innovation that is not subject to market forces is likely to fail for the same reason that the USSR’s emphasis on production without market mechanisms failed.

  

Natural Laws of Innovation/Invention

It is important to understand what is meant by innovating or inventing and what its properties are before embarking on how to encourage or measure technological innovation. Innovating is creating something new. What do we mean by new? Was the light bulb invented by Edison new? There were other electric light bulbs before Edison. Some people suggest that Edison did not really invent the light bulb. One website states “Contrary to what schools have taught for years, the American icon, Thomas Edison, neither invented the light bulb, nor held the first patent to the modern design of the light bulb.”[9](#sdfootnote9sym) Most of Edison’s detractors point to Joseph Wilson Swan as the inventor of the incandescent light bulb. Swan was an English physicist and chemist and applied for a patent on his light bulb before Edison. However, Swan’s light bulbs were low resistance light bulbs. If you tried to setup an electrical power system to power Swan’s light bulbs, it would have required such a large copper conductor as to make the system economically unfeasible. Edison created the first high resistance light bulb making the first commercial electric light system feasible.

Did Edison create something totally new? No, he combined electrical conductors to a high resistance filament inside a glass bulb and created a vacuum in the bulb. The high resistance filament was made of carbonized bamboo. By creating a high resistance light bulb Edison made it possible to setup a commercially viable electrical lighting system that did not require large copper conductors.

Clearly, each of the components or elements of Edison’s light bulb were old. Of course, the components of Swan’s light bulb were also known or old. This is not surprising, since “conservation of matter” dictates that all devices are made of existing components. When we say something is new, we mean that it is a new combination of elements. Patent law describes inventions as combinations of elements and connections. The elements of Edison’s light bulb included electrical conductors, a glass bulb, and a high resistance filament. The connections included placing the high resistance filament inside the glass bulb, connecting the filament between two electrical conductors that extended outside the glass bulb and creating a vacuum in the glass bulb and sealing the glass bulb. How things are connected is as important as what the elements. For instance, if Edison had connected a conductor, filament and glass bulb in series nothing would of happened.

There are a virtually unlimited number of potential innovations. Paul Romer, a professor of economics at Stanford uses the following example to illustrate this point:

On any conceivable horizon -- I'll say until about 5 billion years from now, when the sun explodes -- we're not going to run out of discoveries. Just ask how many things we could make by taking the elements from the periodic table and mixing them together. There's a simple mathematical calculation: It's 10 followed by 30 zeros. In contrast, 10 followed by 19 zeros is about how much time has elapsed since the universe was created.[10](#sdfootnote10sym)

Someone might object that Paul Romer has overstated the number of possible chemical inventions, since not all elements are able to chemically bind to each other. On the other hand, this calculation only includes one of each element. Some of our most important chemical compounds contain long chains of carbon and silicon atoms. In addition, the elements can bond to each other in multiple ways, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. Elements may also have double, triple and quadruple bonds. When you add in all these variations, Dr. Romer has significantly understated the number of possible chemical inventions. This calculation is only for chemistry. When you consider computer networks or electronic circuits with millions of transistors or nodes the number of different possible connection is n(n-1)/2 or easily equal to the number of combinations described for chemistry. This does not begin to name all the possible number of inventions. There is no scarcity in the potential number of ideas or inventions.

Another example that Romer uses to illustrate the unlimited number of possible combinations is all the possible bitstreams you can turn into a CD-ROM. The number is something in the range of 10 to the power of 1 billion, which virtually ensures that we will never run out of software to discover. He notes that there is not enough mass in the universe to make that number of CDs.[11](#sdfootnote11sym)

We know that increases in per capita income are due to innovation and the number of potential innovations is essentially unlimited. Next, we will clarify some matters related to innovations, because these concepts will be important in later chapters.

What do we mean by innovation? We mean the creation of something new. Because of conservation of matter (and energy), new does not mean creating something out of nothing. As used here innovation means a new combination of elements and connections that has positive value to a human being. Combinations of elements and connections that are new but have no value to any human being are generally noise. However, in the case of failed attempts to solve a problem the new combination may have value in what does not work. For instance, Edison considered his attempts to create a light bulb as having negative value. He told a reporter, “I now know definitively over 9,000 ways that an electric light bulb will not work.”

Every innovation can be described as a combination of elements and connections. For instance, music is a series of notes connected by timing. A food dish is a combination of food elements connected by ways of preparing each element and the time at which the elements are combined. Methods of investing are the elements of stocks and financial parameters or technical parameters connected together by a purchase or sale. The connections can be as important as the elements. For instance, stereoisomers are chemical compounds that have exactly the same elements and bonds between the elements, but are mirror images of each other. The two chemical compounds of a stereoisomer are commonly characterized as being right handed or left handed. They are often readily distinguished by biological systems, however, and may have different pharmacokinetic properties (absorption; distribution, biotransformation. and excretion) and quantitatively or qualitatively different pharmacologic or toxicologic effects.[12](#sdfootnote12sym)

An invention is an innovation that has a well defined structure and an objective goal. For instance, a new song is an innovation and it has a well defined structure, but it is not an invention since its goal is the subjective esthetic pleasure of the listener. A management strategy, such as total quality management, is not an invention because the implementation is only an outline and the goal cannot be objectively tested. A software program can be an invention because it has a well defined structure and it may have an objective goal. For instance, find the cheapest published airfare on the internet between L.A. and New York on a certain day.

Earlier we stated that all innovations are combinations of elements and connections. In order to create these combinations the elements and connections must first be known. As a result, discovery proceeds innovation. We must discover those elements and connection found in nature first before we can use them to make an innovation.

An innovation is not the physical embodiment. For instance, one of Edison’s inventions was a high resistance incandescent light bulb. The physical light bulb he built was not the invention, it was an embodiment of the invention. The invention is how to build a high impedance light bulb. A song is not an instance of the song being played. That is a performance of the song. The song is the recipe for the performance.

In summary, all inventions are innovations but not all innovations are inventions. Inventions are innovations that have a well defined structure and an object goal. All innovations are combinations of elements and connections. An innovation is not a specific individual embodiment, but the recipe for making or practicing the innovation. Innovation is proceeded by discovery.

Innovation is the only method of increasing per capita income. Innovation is the process of creating new combinations of elements and connections. Logically innovation proceeds production and production proceeds consumption. If we want to grow our per capita income, then we have to focus our economic policies on encouraging innovation.

Chapter 4: A Short Economic History of the United States

  

The U.S. has been the most innovative country in the history of world. “Virtually every major development in technology in the twentieth century – which was far and away the most important century in the history of technology – originated in the United States or was principally industrialized and turned into consumer products here.”[13](#sdfootnote13sym) The economic success of the U.S. is due to its technological innovation. The first colony was only possible because of two new technologies – the full-rigged sailing ship and the joint-stock company. This inventive spirit has continued to the present with the Information Age, which was founded in the U.S. and based on the internet (ARPANET) invented in 1969.

The first U.S. colony, Virginia, was a joint-stock company, the Virginia Company.[14](#sdfootnote14sym) In 1607 three ships from England landed in Virginia and formed Jamestown. The colony almost failed several times before they found a successful product to export in 1612 – tobacco. By 1618 twenty thousand pounds of tobacco were exported to England assuring the success of the colony. Virginia became the major producer of tobacco for Europe by 1638.[15](#sdfootnote15sym)

During the Constitutional Convention, John Fitch demonstrated one of the first practical steam powered ships on the Delaware River.[16](#sdfootnote16sym) Several of the Constitutional Convention delegates witnessed Fitch’s demonstration of his steamboat. Some people have suggested that this demonstration was in part responsible for the patent and copyright clause of the Constitution. Specifically, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution states: “To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” The clause was unanimously adopted by the Constitutional delegates on September 17, 1787, without debate.[17](#sdfootnote17sym)

Oliver Evans, an American farm boy, created the first automatic production line, built the first wheeled vehicle to move under its own power, built the first amphibious vehicle, and designed and manufactured the first effective high-pressure stream engine.[18](#sdfootnote18sym) Evans was one of America’s first great inventors, creating the first automated flour mill in 1789.[19](#sdfootnote19sym) A flour mill separates wheat from the chaff, then the grain is milled, the ground meal is then spread and dried, and finally packaged. Each of these steps required a person. Evans created a mill in which the cut wheat was poured into one end and packaged flour came out the other end without human intervention.[20](#sdfootnote20sym)

Next, Evans turned his attention to the steam engine. Evans postulated that a high pressure steam engine would be half the weight, use half the fuel, and still be more powerful than a low pressure steam engine such as Watts.[21](#sdfootnote21sym) Besides using high pressure, Evans’ design used steam to push the piston both up and down, while Watts’ steam engine used a condenser to bring the piston down. This allowed more cycles per minute.[22](#sdfootnote22sym) He built one of his high pressure steam engines in 1803 and it proved highly successful. The higher pressure created more power for less weight. Evans then applied his steam engine to an amphibious vehicle.[23](#sdfootnote23sym)

Interestingly, Evans stated, “He that studies and writes on the improvements in the arts and sciences labours to benefit generations yet unborn. For it is improbable that his Contemporaries will pay any attention to him.”[24](#sdfootnote24sym) Unfortunately, this lack of appreciation for inventors appears to still be true today.

Another farm boy, Eli Whitney, while staying on a plantation spent ten days in a barn and created the cotton gin in 1793. In 1791, the entire output of cotton in the U.S. was 4,000 bales. By 1801, the output of cotton was 100,000 bales, over a 50 fold increase. This increase was only possible because of Whitney’s cotton gin.[25](#sdfootnote25sym) You might assume that Whitney made a fortune from his cotton gin given its profound impact on the cotton industry. However, it proved difficult to enforce his patent and most of the money he received for his invention was awarded by grateful states.

Whitney followed up the success of his cotton gin by creating the first interchangeable parts manufacturing system. Whitney proposed in 1798 to make 10,000 – 15,000 muskets using mass manufacturing processes. Up to that time, no one had produced more than 1,500 firearms in a single year.[26](#sdfootnote26sym) While Whitney was not able to meet his goals, he effectively established the American System of Manufacturing that uses an assembly line with workers - each performing a specific job and interchangeable parts.

While the promise of the American System of Manufacturing took years to mature, the U.S. has always been the leader in mass production techniques. The original concept was first proposed in France. Small experiments were tried in England, however, it was the U.S. that embraced and perfected the system. Thomas Jefferson, who proposed that the U.S. should be a nation of self sufficient farmer-philosophers, championed Whitney’s efforts.

Although the U.S. was in its formative period, it was already a leading center of innovation: advancing the steam engine, pushing automation into flour mills, agriculture, and mass manufacturing. The U.S. was never content with just exploiting its large reserves of farmland which had been the major limitation on economic wealth for millennia. The wealth of the U.S. was tirelessly advanced by it innovators.

The U.S.’s initial success in technological innovation did not result in the nation resting on its laurels. Thomas Edison converted electricity from a laboratory curiosity, with few practical applications, into a viable industry with the invention of the first high resistance electrical light bulb. Edison was not the first person to work on an incandescent light bulb. Joseph Swan, an English physicist and chemist, applied for a patent on his light bulb before Edison. However, Swan’s light bulbs were low resistance light bulbs. If you attempted to setup an electrical power system based Swan’s light bulbs, it would required such large copper conductors as to make the system economically unfeasible. Edison created the first high resistance light bulb, which made a commercial electric light system possible. The development of the electrical industry was key to the World’s modern economy and its development was largely driven by U.S. based inventors.

Another key industry for our modern world is the development of the petroleum. While Edwin Drake in Pennsylvania may not have been the first to drill for oil, his contributions were critical in securing the U.S. as a major producer and innovator in this vital industry. By demonstrating that oil could be extracted by drilling and refined for a variety of uses, Drake started the U.S. petroleum industry.

Henry Ford combined the American System of Manufacturing with a petroleum based engine to produce automobiles for the masses. In today’s language, the mass produced automobile was a killer application. It greatly expanded the demand for petroleum, helping that industry grow exponentially. Ford did not invent the first automobile or mass production, but he did perfect both so that cars became affordable for the average family. It was the epitome of the American System of Manufacturing.

The semiconductor industry was invented in the U.S. in 1947 with the advent of the transistor. The transistor was the work of John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley while working at Bell Labs. Transistors are the fundamental building block of modern electronics and the Information Age. These inventors received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 for their invention. Jack Kilby followed this up by inventing the integrated circuit at Texas Instruments in 1958, allowing numerous transistors and other electrical components to be formed on single monolithic block of semiconductor material. The integrated chip (IC) is the modern embodiment of the transistor and ICs can be found in almost every electronic device. Jack Kilby was awarded the Nobel Price in Physics for his invention in 2000.

The next big breakthrough was the microprocessor, a computer on a chip. Three groups, all from the US, are given credit for inventing the microprocessor, namely Intel's 4004, the Texas Instruments (TI) _TMS_1000, and Garrett AiResearch’s Central Air Data Computer (CADC). The Smithsonian Institute credits Texas Instruments’ engineers Gary Boone[27](#sdfootnote27sym) and Michael Cochran for creating the first microcontroller (also called a microcomputer) in 1971. The microprocessor made the modern personal computer industry possible.

The first desktop-size personal computer appeared in 1974; it was offered by Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems (MITS). “The computer, which was called Altair, retailed for slightly less than $400. The demand for the microcomputer kit was immediate, unexpected, and totally overwhelming. Scores of small entrepreneurial companies responded to this demand by producing computers for the new market. The first major electronics firm to manufacture and sell personal computers, Tandy Corporation (Radio Shack), introduced its model in 1977. It quickly dominated the field, because of the combination of two attractive features: a keyboard and a cathode-ray display terminal (CRT).”[28](#sdfootnote28sym) In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created a homemade microprocessor computer board called Apple I.

The first killer application for the personal computer was VisiCalc - the world’s first spreadsheet. Dan Bricklin was the inventor and with Bob Frankston he created Personal Software in 1979 to market VisiCalc which ran on an Apple II. This propelled the Apple II from a hobbiest toy to a business tool. The personal computer dominated the technological innovation of the 80s destroying several iconic computer companies in its wake including Digital Equipment, Wang and Apollo.

Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina created the web browser Mosaic, which, if not the first web browser, was the first web browser to catch on with the public. Andreessen went on to found Netscape, which produced Netscape Navigator in 1994. The web browser was paramount to making the Internet a useful tool for the individual. The Internet explosion of the 1990s was a period of incredible innovation. It brought us companies such as Amazon.com, eBay, Netscape, Priceline, Broadcom, and AOL to name a few. All of which relied on a web browser and HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). A number of these companies created businesses that economist only dreamed of in their models. For instance, Priceline allowed companies and consumers to set the price of unfilled airline seats or hotel rooms by auction. This had been postulated as the best way for airlines to maximize revenue and reduce consumer costs. eBay created a nationwide auction for products eliminating much of the costs of distribution. Much of this innovation was funded by venture capital or angel capital. Without ready access to risk capital and a vibrant public market as an exit strategy, this explosion of innovation would not have been possible.

The economic growth of the U.S. is due to its incredible innovation. From its founding, the U.S. has been blessed with innumerable inventors and innovators that have propelled the U.S. from a backwoods fledgling country to the richest country in the history of the world with unprecedented speed. When the U.S. has turned away from innovation and not supported its inventors it has suffered economic stagnation and decline.

Why has the U.S. been so innovative? Partly the U.S. was the child of England, which was the birthplace of the industrial revolution. This gave the U.S. a head start and provided a culture that was fertile for innovation. Taking advantage of this head start, the U.S. adopted and perfected policies that encouraged innovation. For instance, the U.S. Constitution provided for patents and copyrights.[29](#sdfootnote29sym) While England had a de facto patent system, the U.S. established the first de jure patent system. This provided inventors a legal right to a patent as opposed to patents that were granted at the grace of the Crown. The U.S. experimented with its patent system until it created a system having all the elements of a modern patent system in 1836. The U.S. patent system was established by statute in 1790.[30](#sdfootnote30sym) The statute allowed an inventor to apply for a patent from the Secretary of State, Secretary of War or the Attorney General.[31](#sdfootnote31sym) The inventor had to provide a description of the invention, a drawing, and a model. This information had to be sufficient for one skilled in the art to build the invention.[32](#sdfootnote32sym) If upon examination of the patent application the Secretary of State, Secretary of War or the Attorney General found the invention sufficiently useful and important they could issue a patent.[33](#sdfootnote33sym) This system was too time consuming for Secretary of State, Secretary of War and the Attorney General, so it was replaced with a registration system in 1793.[34](#sdfootnote34sym) However, the registration system for patents resulted in many frivolous patents, some fraud, and ultimately expensive litigation.[35](#sdfootnote35sym) The Patent Act of 1836 established the patent office with independent examiners.[36](#sdfootnote36sym) These examiners were hired based upon their skill in the technology of the inventions they examined.

The patent system was critical to developing an environment that fostered innovation. The joint stock company and a stock market were also critical to American’s innovation. The U.S.’s first stock market began operations in 1790 in Philadelphia. The colony of Virginia was a joint stock company. While corporate status was tightly control in the early days of the U.S., being able to form a corporation was vital in developing risky technological innovations. The U.S. embraced financial innovations that encouraged investment in new technologies without the fear of financial devastation to the shareholders. Another important financial/legal innovation was bankruptcy. While the U.S. struggled to find a workable bankruptcy law for many years, eventually the U.S. settled on a system, which attempts to maximize the economic value of the assets involved. These laws are important because they encourage risk taking, which is vital to innovation. Innovation involves failure as well as success. The U.S. by adopting policies that did not punish failure allowed people to innovate.

On top of these legal and financial innovations, the cultural foundation of the U.S. was the philosophy of Natural Law. The second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence is a restatement of Locke’s natural laws. Specifically, the second paragraph states:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed

The “pursuit of happiness” clause was substituted for Locke’s “right to property” because Jefferson, the main author of the Declaration of Independence, was concern that a right to property would be interpreted as the right to slavery.

Natural Law is based on reason,[37](#sdfootnote37sym) which is the basis of science. Technological progress is based on science – empirical reasoning. Our legal common law system was inherited from England. Common law is the application of Natural Law to societal laws.

The U.S. was blessed to be the child of England at the height of the influence of the Natural Law philosophy. However, the U.S. did not just adopt the attitudes of its mother country – it fulfilled the promise of its ideals. The U.S. was truer to England’s ideals of Natural Philosophy than England ever achieved. The U.S. created the first modern patent system, provided a corporate structure for investing in risky technologies and created a stock market that provided capital to propel innovative companies.

  

Chapter 5: Intellectual Property Socialism

  

"A country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab and couldn't travel anyway but sideways and backwards", Mark Twain- Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court

  

  

The high technology start-up model requires intellectual capital. A company needs to acquire title to this intellectual capital, because this is often its only asset. Patents are the main legal tool for acquiring title to innovations forming the intellectual capital of a high technology start-up company.

Starting in the late 1990’s patents came under attack from a number of companies, economists and intellectuals. A rallying point for these anti-patent crusaders was the Amazon “one click” patent covering the use of a one-step system for ordering items online. A number of competitors quickly copied Amazon’s one click ordering system. Complaints against the Amazon “one click” patent included: it was not novel, it was obvious, it was a trivial invention, and it was easy to program such a system. The anti-patent movement forced a number of changes to patent laws in the decade from 1999 to 2009. These changes tend to reduce the benefits to the inventor and allow society to use other peoples’ inventions with less cost and risk. In other words, these rules socialized the benefits of inventions but kept the cost private.[38](#sdfootnote38sym)

  

Patent Theory and History

Patents have always been an instrument of industrial policy by countries. The purpose of these early patents was to strengthen local industry and patents were awarded as special privileges from the Monarchy or legislature. Countries tried other incentive systems such as annuities, cash prizes, and titles as methods to encourage technological innovation and industry.[39](#sdfootnote39sym) The U.S. still uses cash prizes in the form of grants for scientific and industrial research and in the form of contests with prizes as an instrument of industrial policy. The first modern patent system was created in the U.S. in 1790. A modern patent system is characterized by an examination system administered by an independent examination core that is readily accessible to all inventors – as opposed to only wealthy or politically connected inventors. Also, such a system provides for the diffusion of knowledge. Recent research has shown that the U.S .patent system in 19th century met these goals. Inventors obtaining patents in the U.S. were from all occupations, varying economic circumstances, included men, women, and even slaves, and were dispersed geographically throughout the US.[40](#sdfootnote40sym)

Patents are often considered a social contract, a reward system, or a property right.[41](#sdfootnote41sym) The U.S. constitution emphasizes both the industrial policy and social contract nature of patents as:

To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries – Article 1, Section 8 U.S.Constitution.

The social contract theory of patents is a trade between the inventor and society. The inventor is given a limited term property right in exchange for disclosing how to practice their invention. The reward system emphasizes that the inventor receives an award, such as a limited term to exclude others from using his invention. While the property theory of patents emphasizes that, like tangible property, an inventor owns the product of his labor (physical and mental).[42](#sdfootnote42sym)

The U.S. patent system was established by statute in 1790.[43](#sdfootnote43sym) The statute allowed an inventor to apply for a patent from the Secretary of State, Secretary of War or the Attorney General.[44](#sdfootnote44sym) The inventor had to provide a description of the invention, a drawing, and a model. This information had to be sufficient for one skilled in the art to build the invention.[45](#sdfootnote45sym) If upon examination of the patent application the Secretary of State, Secretary of War or the Attorney General found the invention sufficiently useful and important they could issue a patent.[46](#sdfootnote46sym) This system was too time consuming for Secretary of State, Secretary of War and the Attorney General, so it was replaced with a registration system in 1793.[47](#sdfootnote47sym) However, the registration system for patents resulted in many frivolous patents, some fraud, and ultimately expensive litigation.[48](#sdfootnote48sym) The Patent Act of 1836 established the patent office with independent examiners.[49](#sdfootnote49sym) These examiners were hired based upon their skill in the technology of the inventions they examined.

The perceived success of the U.S. patent system in encouraging technological development caused a number of countries to emulate the U.S. patent system.[50](#sdfootnote50sym) However, in the latter half of the 19th century in Europe an abolitionist movement against patents grew.[51](#sdfootnote51sym) This movement argued that patents impeded competition and free trade.[52](#sdfootnote52sym) Holland went so far as to repeal its patent laws in 1869, however they reinstated patent rights in 1912.[53](#sdfootnote53sym) This anti-patent sentiment did not seem to infect the US. However, by the 1930s antitrust concerns about patents in the U.S. began to surface. This backlash against patents reached its zenith with a Supreme Court judge writing “the only patent that is valid is one which this (the Supreme) Court has not yet been able to get its hands on.”[54](#sdfootnote54sym) The 1952 Patent Act reaffirmed the rights of inventors to obtain patents if their invention was novel and nonobvious. The nonobvious requirement was new and appears to have been in reaction to a Supreme Court case that required “a flash of genius” in order to obtain a patent.[55](#sdfootnote55sym) The “flash of genius” standard was arbitrary and inventions that were the result of years of research did not fit the “flash” part of the standard. For example, Edison’s high impedance light bulb resulted from intensive research and did not exhibit a “flash of genius”. The general economic and technological fortunes of the U.S. followed the attitudes towards patents.[56](#sdfootnote56sym) Favorable treatment of patents in the 19th century coincided with the U.S. advance from a minor economic player into the world’s greatest industrial economy. While, anti-patent attitudes that prevailed in 1930’s corresponded with the Great Depression. The anti-patent rulings of the Supreme Court in the 1940’s gave way to a more favorable legislation towards patents encompassed in the 1952 patent legislation. This more favorable atmosphere for patents seemed to hold through the 1950s and most of the 1960s and corresponded to strong economic and technological growth.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with their nine no-nos with respect to patents in the 1970’s[57](#sdfootnote57sym), signaled a major shift in policy towards patents. These anti-patent policies reached absurd levels in the FTC consent decree against Xerox in 1975 that required Xerox to dedicate its patent portfolio to its competitors.[58](#sdfootnote58sym) By the late 1970’s there was widespread concern that the U.S.had lost its economic and technological edge. Our auto industry and our semiconductor industry were about to be overtaken and made obsolete by the Japanese and others.

In reaction to these concerns, our patent laws were strengthened in the 1980s. For instance, all patent appeals were consolidated into the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) created in 1982.[59](#sdfootnote59sym) A number of the initial judges on the CAFC were former patent attorneys and the court brought consistency to patent appeals. The court also took seriously the idea that issued patents are presumed to be valid. These changes signaled a more favorable atmosphere for patents in the 1980’s. Before the CAFC patents were treated differently in each of the federal court circuits. Some circuits had not upheld the validity of a patent in decades. The new court brought a sense of stability to patent law. The 1980’s saw a restoration of America’s economic and technological dominance in the world.

The Supreme Court also displayed a more favorable attitude towards patents. In, Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), the Supreme Court decided that genetically modified microorganisms could be patented. In [Diamond v. Diehr](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Diamond_v._Diehr), 450 U.S. 175 (1981) the Supreme Court stated that while mathematical algorithms per se were not patentable, inventions incorporating mathematical algorithms that were otherwise directed to statutory matter were patentable. These cases set the stage for two of the most significant start-up industries in the 1980’s and 1990’s, specifically the software and biotechnology industry.

The legislative environment was also favorable to patents in the 1980’s. Extending the life of a patent to compensate for the delay in securing marketing authority from the FDA, became possible in 1984. 35 USC 156. The definition of infringement was amended to include export of kits of parts to make a product, which if made in the U.S.would be an infringement of a U.S.patent. 35 USC 271(f). In 1988 the definition of infringement was again expanded to include importation of products made by a process that violates a U.S.patent, 35 USC 271 (g) and a request for marketing approval for a patented drug to be effective before the expiration of a U.S.patent 35 USC 271 (e). In a reaction to FTC’s nine no-nos, the Patent Misuse Reform Act was passed in 1988, that made it clear that a patent was not unenforceable if the patentee refused to license their patent or used a patent tying arrangement.

The 1990’s continued the pro-patent trend. The definition of infringement was extended to acts in outer space controlled by the U.S. in 1990, 35 USC 105, and state governments were made liable for acts of patent infringement in 1992. In 1995 the law on obviousness for a biotechnology process was changed, making a process resulting in a new and nonobvious product sufficient to support a conclusion of nonobviousness, 35 USC 103(b). The United State Patent Office officially started allowing claims to software stored on a computer readable medium in 1995. This allowed patent claims directed to a computer disk. As a result, a patent owner could sue someone for owning a computer disk with infringing software. This seemed to be the end of the Patent Office’s sad history of denying patent protection to software enabled inventions.

The culmination of this pro-patent trend was _State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc_., 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In this case, Signature Financial had obtained a patent on a "Hub and Spoke" method of running mutual funds. In this method, several mutual funds (or "spokes") pool their investment assets into a single investment portfolio (the "hub"). Software then determines the value of each fund based upon a percentage ownership of each of the assets in the hub portfolio. This information was tracked on a daily basis, and is used to track fund share pricing and tax accountability. State Street Bank asked the court to declare this invention unpatentable as a mere mathematical algorithm or as a business method. They pointed out that the patent claim comprised steps that are the requirements specified in an Internal Revenue Service regulation for avoiding taxes on a partnership. The Federal Circuit rejected the arguments of State Street Bank, and instead upheld the patent by explicitly stating that business methods can form patentable subject matter. The court emphasized that software or other processes that yield a useful, concrete, and tangible result should be considered patentable.

A backlash against this pro-patent trend was already forming by the late 1990s. The main focus of the backlash was the “Amazon one click patent,” that allowed a user to order online using a single click. Amazon.com applied for the patent in 1997 and it issued in 1999 as patent number 5,960,411. A number of competitors had copied Amazon’s one click ordering system and shortly after the patent issued, Amazon.com sued Barnes and Noble for infringement.[60](#sdfootnote60sym) Industry studies showed that between sixty and sixty-five percent of online shopping baskets abandon before they check out. The primary reason for abandoned shopping carts seems to be buyer confusion and annoyance with the online purchasing process. Presumably, many of those abandoned shopping carts represent lost sales. The goal of the one click method for online shopping was to make the process simpler, faster, and more secure thereby capturing some of that lost business. Barnes and Noble's Express Lane (one click shopping system) was evidently successful, since a large percentage of their customers had chosen to utilize the Express Lane rather than the shopping basket.

Anti-patent activists started a boycott against Amazon.com because of the one click patent issue.[61](#sdfootnote61sym) The one click patent was the subject of many critical articles that suggested the invention was trivial, that the one click patent was obvious, that the one click process was trivial to program and that software should not be patentable. The sad and ironic component to this controversy is that it is easy to design around the claims of the one click patent. Design around means to invent an alternative to a patented invention that does not infringe the patent’s claims. In this case, all Barnes and Noble or any other online retailer had to do to design around the claims of the one click patent was have a two click ordering system. However, few of the critics of Amazon.com and the one click patent mentioned this simple solution. Nor was there any complaint that Barnes and Noble was essentially too lazy to spend the time and effort to come up with this simple design around solution. One of the functions the patent system promotes is alternative designs to problems[62](#sdfootnote62sym) by creating an economic incentive to create alternative designs.

Most of the critics of the Amazon one click patent, either do not understand patents and the role of claims in patents or they are just openly hostile to software patents. For example, the Free Software Foundation has a movement to end the patenting of software, believing that software patents inhibit development of software. The Free Software Foundation never criticized Barnes and Noble for being too lazy to design around the claims of Amazon.com’s patent because they are fundamentally opposed to software patents.

The arguments against software patents have a fundamental flaw. As any electrical engineer knows, solutions to problems implemented in software can also be realized in hardware, i.e., electronic circuits. The main reason for choosing a software solution is the ease in implementing changes, the main reason for choosing a hardware solution is speed of processing. Therefore, a time critical solution is more likely to be implemented in hardware. While a solution that requires the ability to add features easily will be implemented in software. As a result, to be intellectually consistent those people against software patents also have to be against patents for electronic circuits. Of course, some of them are opposed to patents more generally; however, the historical record has shown that patents have been effective in encouraging technological development.

Patent Law and Policy since 2000

Harmonization of U.S.patent law with other patent laws around the world is another trend that started in the 1990s. The first effort to start harmonizing U.S.patent law with patent laws around the world, was the change in the term of a patent from 17 years from the date of issuance to 20 years from the date of filing, 35 USC 154. The arguments for this change included harmonization with the rest of the world, the effective term of most patents is unchanged, and the change eliminates submarine patents. Wikipedia defines a submarine patent as an informal term for a patent first published and granted long after the initial application was filed. Like a submarine, its presence is unknown to the public; it stays under water, i.e., unpublished, for long periods, then emerges, i.e., granted and published, and surprises the relevant market. Jerome H. Lemelson was the poster child for submarine patents. Mr. Lemelson had patents that issued in the late 1980s and early 1990s that were based on patent applications from the 1950’s, i.e., submarine patents. This was generally regarded as unfair, because a potential infringer would not have notice that a patent covered their product or process. Mr. Lemelson’s most successful patents were related to machine vision. However, many of the claims of his key patents on machine vision were held invalid in 2004.[64](#sdfootnote64sym)

Other commentators have suggested that “submarine” patents were caused by the inefficiencies of the U.S.Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).[65](#sdfootnote65sym) One of the most cited of these is patent No. 5,283,641 to Mr. Lemelson. This patent was subject to a 20 way divisional (the Patent Office required the original patent application be divided into 20 separate patent applications), which was the major cause of the delay in this patent issuing. The term “submarine patents” first appeared in Japan and may have been an attempt to persuade the U.S.to adopt a Japanese style patent system. The Japanese patent system is widely viewed as unfriendly to individual inventors and small companies.

The next step in harmonization was the Intellectual Property and Communication Omnibus Reform Act of 1999. This required publication of U.S.patent applications 18 months from the filing (priority) date, expect for patent applications that explicitly requested non-publication and will never be filed in a foreign country 35 USC 122 (b). The argument for this change besides harmonization is increased patent quality and notice to potential infringers. By publishing patent applications, the invention would not remain hidden from the public and would add to the store of known prior art an Examiner at the Patent Office could cite against other patent applications. Large companies that filed internationally were in favor of this change. Large companies generally file their patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, almost all of which publish patent application at 18 months. As a result, their patent application are published at 18 months anyway. Small and independent inventors were against this change in the patent laws. Independent inventors were placated with the promise that most patent applications issue around 18 months from the date of their filing anyway, so they were not giving up any significant amount of time that their inventions were kept secret.

While this legislation was not widely seen as anti-patent at the time, its effects have clearly been to enhance the rights of adopters of technology at the expense of creators of technology. The publication rule is a clear violation of the social contract between the inventor and society. Under the publication rule, society gets the advantage of the disclosure of the invention even if the inventor never receives any property rights in his invention. Before the publication rule if an inventor felt that the scope of the claims to his invention were too narrow or not allowable, he could withdraw his application and keep his invention a trade secret. Narrow claims are easy for a competitor to design around providing little protection in exchange for the disclosure of the invention. In other words if the inventor did not like the deal he was offered from the Patent Office he could reject it and keep his invention a secret. Even for inventions that can be reverse engineered once the invention is marketed, this is a better deal than the publication rule. Under the publication rule, it is easy for competitors to find the inventor’s idea on the World Wide Web and copy the invention. Without publication, a competitor has to spend the time and money to reverse engineer the invention. This is significantly more costly than reading a patent application that describes the invention in “enough detail that one skilled in the art can practice the invention.” 35 USC 112. The publication rule is perhaps the most egregious anti-patent change in the patent laws in the history of the US. It does not promote the useful arts, since it decreases the incentive to file for a patent, which also decreases the diffusion of knowledge by the patent system. The publication rule should be declared unconstitutional, but as we will see, it is unlikely any relief will be forthcoming from the U.S.Supreme Court.

Presently there is a proposal to further harmonize our patent laws with the rest of the world by converting our patent system from a “first to invent” to a “first to file.”[66](#sdfootnote66sym) It is being sold as a minor change, since only about 1% of patent applications are ever involved an interference – a case to determine who is the first inventor. In addition, the first applicant to file wins most interference cases. However, this will further biases the patent system in favor of large corporations who can afford to file speculative patents on incomplete inventions. Individual inventors cannot afford this expense and are likely to lose out in the race to the patent office. In addition, it is likely to result in poorly thought out patent applications and waste the U.S.Patent Office’s resources. Other countries’ patent systems are not designed to protect the interests of small individual inventors and start-ups.

The stance of the courts has turned decidedly anti-patent since 2000. In 2006 the U.S. Supreme Court decided _eBay Inc v. MercExchange, L.L.C._, 547 U.S. 388 (2006) holding that a permanent injunction should not automatically issue as part of a judgment of infringement. A patent is a legal right to exclude, 35 USC 154, others from making, using, selling (offering for sale), or importing the invention. It is a little known fact that a patent does not give the holder the right to use, make, sell (offer for sale) or import the invention.[67](#sdfootnote67sym) The Supreme Court’s eBay decision denies a patent holder’s right to exclude others and substitutes monetary damages even if the patent holder prefers to enforce their right to exclude. The Supreme Court’s eBay decision overturned 20-25 years of jurisprudence that recognized that an injunction was the only relief a court could provide against an infringer that was consistent with a patent holder’s “right to exclude.”

In 2007 the Supreme Court in the _Medimmune, Inc. v. Genetech, Inc._, 549 U.S. 118 (2007), overturned a long-standing rule that a licensed patent user cannot file a declaratory judgment action when they have not breached the license terms. Article III of the U.S. Constitution prohibits going to court for an advisory opinion; there must be an actual controversy between parties with adverse legal interests. Under the Medimmune decision a patent licensee can sue the patent holder complaining the patent is invalid while claiming that they are not infringing the patent or in breach of the license. As a result, it is a no-lose situation for a licensee to file a declaratory judgment action against the patent holder claiming the patent is invalid. If the Licensee is successful in court, they no longer have to pay royalties to the patent holder and if they lose, they are in the same position as they were before the lawsuit was filed. The patent holder is forced to defend their patent with nothing to gain if they win; as a result, the patent holder has no actual controversy with the licensee. This case is clearly inconsistent with Article III of the U.S. Constitution.

In _KSR International v. Teleflex_, 550 U.S. 398 (2007) the Supreme Court made it easier to find a patent invalid and harder to obtain a patent by changing the standard for obviousness. In order to obtain a patent, the invention has to useful, novel, and non-obvious. The Supreme Court overturned 20 years of jurisprudence associated with an objective test of obviousness. The Supreme Court rejected any objective test of obviousness as too rigid. This more flexible approach increases the uncertainty that an inventor will receive a patent and increases the risk that their patent will be held invalid if they have to enforce their patent against an infringer. It also increased the costs associated with obtaining a patent and in enforcing a patent.

As a result of these three cases the Supreme Court has denied patent holders their “right to exclude”, allowed companies that license a patent to challenge the patent they licensed at no risk and made it more difficult for an inventor to obtain a patent and enforce the patent once it is obtained. Short of declaring the patent system unconstitutional, it is hard to see how the Supreme Court could have done more damage to the rights of inventors.

Not to be outdone, the Patent and Trademark Office launched their own assault on inventors. The allowance rate for patents has dropped from around 70% in 2000 down to 45% in 2008. The allowance rate had hovered around 62%-72% for several decades and then started a precipitous drop around 2003.

  

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375755y_tmp_7aaf9fb1695b9ec4.jpg)

  

Apparently, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office decided that low allowance rates are associated with more thorough examinations of patent applications[68](#sdfootnote68sym) and that the allowance rates of the U.S. Patent Office were too high. The author filed a Freedom of Information Action Request (FOIA request) with the Patent Office asking for the basis of this assumption. The response to the FOIA request was the paper _Overview of Recent changes and Comparison of Patent Regimes in the United States, Japan and Europe_, in Patents, Innovations and Economic Performance: OECD Conference Proceedings 127, 145 (2004). There was no explanation why the U.S. Patent Office considered this paper so important. In addition, no papers were provided of any discussions or policy decisions to implement a policy to pursue a lower allowance rate. Given the dramatic fall in the allowance rate and the size of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, you would assume that there had to be some discussion to implement a policy of lower allowance rates.

This paper suggested that the U.S. grant rate was significantly higher than the European Patent Office’s grant rate. Specifically it stated that the grant rate for patent applications originating in the U.S. was significantly higher in the United States Patent and Trademark Office than in the European Patent Office. In addition the paper stated, the grant rate for patent applications originating at the European Patent Office was somewhat higher in the United States Patent and Trademark Office than in the European Patent Office. Many factors effect grant rates other than the rigors of the examination process. Specifically, a patent applicant will consider the cost of obtaining a patent, the size of the market the patent will protect, the cost of maintaining the patent, etc. The cost of obtaining a patent through the European Patent Office is between 50% and 100% more for a U.S. based patent applicant than obtaining a patent in the United States Patent Office. Once an applicant obtains allowance for their patent application at the European Patent Office, they have to pay an issue fee in each European country they want patent protection. They also pay the cost of translation if that country’s language is different. In addition, the patent maintenance fees or annuities, which have to be paid to keep the patent in force, are significantly higher in European countries than the United States. It cost considerably more to obtain a set of patents in Europe that cover the same size market as the United States. Naturally, many applicants decide that obtaining a patent in the United States is much more important than obtaining a patent or patents in Europe. If the patent applicant has limited resources, he will drop the European patent application and continue to pursue his U.S. patent application. The United States provides the best value in patents when you compare the size of the market covered to the cost of obtaining and maintaining a patent. It is not surprising that the allowance rate is higher in the United States.

As part of the United States Patent and Trademark Office goal to lower allowance and grant rates for patents they instituted several “quality” metrics. According to a Commerce Department report[69](#sdfootnote69sym) on the United States Patent and Trademark Office, two of the key quality metrics the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office uses are the examiner allowance rate and the examiner grant rate. The report states “. . . the assumption being that the lower the rates, the more rigorous the examination process.” The only possible reason for tracking individual examiner allowance rates is to evaluate the examiner’s performance. An examiner with a higher allowance rate than average is considered to be doing poor quality work. This results in examiners considering not only the statutory requirements for obtaining a patent when reviewing a patent application, but also their allowance rate. Similar pressures apply to the supervisory examiners and the Patent Board of Appeals. The goal of a lower allowance rate inserts an additional substantive rule to obtain a patent. Because the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s goal of lower allowance rates forces examiners to consider non-statutory requirements in determining whether a patent application is allowable, they have instituted an illegal standard of patentability.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office’s policy to reduce allowance rates for patent applications, which appears to have started around 2003, in conjunction with the publication rule that broke the social contract between the inventor and society is a kiss of death to American innovation.

Not to be outdone a number of academic articles have attacked the patent system. Perhaps the most influential was _The Tragedy of the Anticommons._[70](#sdfootnote70sym) The title of this paper is a play on the classic economics problem where no one owns a resource so that it becomes overused, such as public grazing land. If a rancher uses grazing lands he does not own, what is his incentive to use the land sparingly? If the rancher does not use the land extensively, another rancher may. The anticommons thesis is that if too many people share an ownership right in a resource they will block each other from developing the resource. The paper applies the concept to many aspects of the economy. When it is applied to patents, it is generally referred to as a “patent thicket.” The argument being that too many patent holders will block each others ability to develop an area of technology. Anticommons proponents suggest that a patent thicket exists with respect to the software and biomedical industry. If a patent thicket existed in the biotech industry, we would expect a decrease in economic activity in the biotech industry as companies are locked out of the market. However, a study of the number of start-ups, venture capital funding, number of product introductions in the biotech industry shows the exact opposite situation.[71](#sdfootnote71sym) If a study was done of the software industry in the 1980’s and 1990’s it would clearly show a major increase in economic activity in the software industry as evidenced by the number of start-ups, amount of venture capital invested, product introductions, and employment. Therefore, the empirical evidence does not support the patent thicket argument. Historical evidence of patents blocking development is also lacking.

Several papers[72](#sdfootnote72sym) have pointed out that the anticommons argument for patents is based on flawed analogies. One common analogy for the anticommons problem is a river in which multiple entities charge toll to pass. No one entity has an incentive to maximize the revenue from the total tolls collected, so they each attempt to maximize their toll price, which causes underutilization of the river. This example assumes a single starting point and a single ending point. However, the “geography” of the technology world is more complex as there are multiple ways to get from point A to point B. In fact, railroads, highways, and airplanes all represent ways around the toll problem on the river. As long as government does not put artificial limitations on these competing technologies, they will develop solutions that also encompass many more starting and ending points, which are more convenient for the customer. Note that one of the goals of patent law is to develop these alternative solutions. The _Tragedy of the Anticommons_ as applied to patents has no empirical support and is based on analogies that are logically flawed.

Another academic attack on the patent system is based on the “Scarcity Theory of Property Rights.” A number of scholars[73](#sdfootnote73sym) have suggested that the logical basis for tangible property rights is scarcity. Property rights efficiently allocate these resources and avoid conflicts between competing rights of individuals. These scholars argue that ideas and invention are not subject to scarcity and therefore intellectual property rights should not exist. These arguments seem to be particularly prevalent among Libertarians, including the Cato Institute and Von Mises Institute, and the open source community.

Tangible property rights includes real property rights in land and buildings and personal property rights in things like cars and furniture. Tangible or physical property is scarce since it can only be owned by one person at a time and it takes resources to create it. Intangible or intellectual property such as patents and trademarks, and software in the case of the open source community, is not scarce and can be owned by multiple people without excluding others from the property. According to Tom G. Palmer, an advocate of the “scarcity theory of property rights”:

  

It is this scarcity that gives rise to property rights. Intellectual property rights, however, do not rest on a natural scarcity of goods, but on an “artificial, self created scarcity.”[74](#sdfootnote74sym)

  

Scarcity is not the historical or logical basis of private property rights. The historical justification of property rights are based on the right that a person owns himself. If you do not own yourself, you are a slave. If you own yourself then you own the fruits of your labor, physical and mental. This is commonly referred to the “natural rights labor theory of property.”

In the pre-capitalist eras, private property existed de facto, but not de jure, _i.e._, by custom and sufferance, not by right or by law. In law and in principle, all property belonged to the head of the tribe, the king, and was held only by his permission, which could be revoked at any time, at his pleasure. (The king could and did expropriate the estates of recalcitrant noblemen throughout the course of Europe’s history.)[75](#sdfootnote75sym)

The labor theory of property provided the foundation of property rights as opposed to property as a custom. As a result, the scholars who suggest that property rights are based on scarcity are incorrect historically.

Despite this historical inaccuracy, perhaps “scarcity” is a better theoretical framework for the justification of property rights. The natural rights labor theory of property explains why slavery is immoral. If you own yourself, then no one else has the right to own you. It also explains why murder and manslaughter are immoral, why stealing is immoral, why assault and battery are immoral and why we have laws against all these actions. The natural rights labor theory defines how property should be allocated and how people come into possession of property morally and legally. The labor theory explains all of our basic criminal law and all of our basic property laws. What does scarcity explain? It offers no justification for why slavery, murder, manslaughter, assault, battery, and theft are immoral, except that they are inefficient at allocating resources. Thus, all of these crimes would be allowed if they were efficient at allocating resources. Scarcity does not explain who has ownership in property or why they should have ownership in property. It merely explains that private property ownership is an efficient manner in allocating scarce resources.

In science, the theory that has the greatest ability to explain the widest number of facts is considered to be the correct or better theory. Here the “scarcity” theory of private property requires the additional assumption that it is preferable to have efficient allocation of resources. However, it fails to explain how the resource should be initially distributed, it does not explain how property law determines ownership and has no power to explain criminal law. Trading scarcity for the labor theory of property is like trading the theory that “what goes up must come down” for Newton’s Law of gravity. The fact of the matter is that the proponents of scarcity have confused cause with effect. A system of private property results in efficient allocation of scarce resources, but it is not the reason for private property – it is the effect of private property.

Is there scarcity in the creating of ideas? Patents, one of the types of intellectual property rights, are based on creating new ideas or inventions. The number of potential inventions appears to be almost limitless. For instance, Paul Romer, a professor of economics at Stanford states:

  

On any conceivable horizon -- I'll say until about 5 billion years from now, when the sun explodes -- we're not going to run out of discoveries. Just ask how many things we could make by taking the elements from the periodic table and mixing them together. There's a simple mathematical calculation: It's 10 followed by 30 zeros. In contrast, 10 followed by 19 zeros is about how much time has elapsed since the universe was created.[76](#sdfootnote76sym)

  

Someone might object that Paul Romer has overstated the number of possible chemical inventions, since not all elements are able to chemically bind to each other. On the other hand, this calculation only includes one of each element. Some of our most important chemical compounds contain long chains of carbon and silicon atoms. In addition, the elements can bond to each other in multiple ways, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. Elements may also have double, triple and quadruple bonds. When you add in all these variations, Dr. Romer’s example significantly understates the possible number of chemical inventions. This calculation is only for chemistry. When you consider computer networks or electronic circuits with millions of transistors or nodes the number of different possible connection is n(n-1)/2 or easily equal to the number of combinations described for chemistry. This does not begin to name all the possible number of inventions. This would seem to argue for a lack of scarcity on the conception of ideas or inventions.

Although there are unlimited number of potential inventions, this does not mean that creating them is free. The U.S. spends over $300 billion a year on research and development to discover inventions.[77](#sdfootnote77sym) Either the U.S. government and numerous high technology companies are wasting a tremendous amount of money on a fraud, or the conception of inventions is subject to scarcity. Just like real property conceiving inventions takes scarce resources. The number of researchers, research facilities, and research equipment are all subject to scarcity. Each researcher’s ability to pursue various inventions and discoveries is limited. Clearly, the proponents of the scarcity theory of property are incorrect that the development of inventions and innovations is not subject scarcity.

Is there scarcity in the adoption and distribution of technology? If there is no scarcity for the adoption of technology, we would expect that in the absence of intellectual property rights new technologies would be instantly and universally adopted.

Scientific principles are not subject to intellectual property rights. Calculus was discovered over 300 year ago and is not the subject of intellectual property rights. Despite this only a small percentage of the population understands it even in the most advanced economies. Those people that do understand calculus generally paid an instructor to learn this area of math even though books on the subject can be reviewed for free at many libraries. Almost everything a student learns through formal education, even in graduate school, is information that is readily available. Even if the text book is copyrighted, the information is usually available in a non-copyrighted form or available for free from a library. Despite this the U.S. spends over $500 billion a year on all forms of education. Clearly, the cost of adopting and distribution ideas including inventions is not free and is subject to scarcity.

According to venture capitalists, most start-ups will spend 2-10 times the amount on marketing their inventions than on developing them. If the distribution of ideas was free, not subject to scarcity, this would clearly be unnecessary.

University professors, doctors, lawyers, engineers, judges, marketers, sales people and computer scientists are mainly in the business of distributing or implementing known information. If distributing information is free, not subject to scarcity, then all these people should either be thrown in jail for fraud or paid less than the average day laborer.

The U.S. has historically provided the strongest legal protection for inventions.[78](#sdfootnote78sym) The U.S. is not only the leader in the creation of new technology, but has had the fastest adoption and diffusion of new technologies. Countries that had or have weak patent laws are associated with the slowest adoption and diffusion rates for new technologies. This is in complete contradiction to the expected result predicted by advocates of the scarcity theory of property.

The libertarians and open source advocates are clearly incorrect that inventions and ideas are not subject to scarcity. This scarcity is not artificially induced, since strong patent laws are associate with greater rates of technology adoption and diffusion.

Advocates of the scarcity theory of property are correct that two people can understand the same idea (calculus) without diminishing the supply of the idea. However, this is not the same thing as both people being the inventor of or discover of the idea. Just because I understand calculus does not make me the discoverer of calculus any more than understanding how a steam engine works makes me the inventor of the steam engine. If I were to conceive special relativity without any knowledge that Einstein had already discovered special relativity, this would not make me the discoverer of special relativity. I did not add any information to the store of human knowledge, by my independent discovery. The same is true of inventors, just because someone independently comes up with an idea after the inventor, does not make them an inventor. An inventor is the person who adds to the store of human knowledge. Being second, even without knowing that you are second does not add to the store of human knowledge or make you an inventor. The patent laws require the inventor to be the first in the world to create an invention.

The debate over the whether property rights are conceptually based on scarcity or based on the right of a person to their labor both physical and mental is not just an academic exercise. Failure to provide strong legal protection to inventors has severe consequences for our economic growth rate. The U.S. does not have the luxury of just adopting other countries’ technology to provide economic growth, it must innovate in order to have an increasing standard of living for its citizens. By denying the value of intellectual labor, libertarians have more closely aligned themselves with Marx’s labor (physical) theory of value than with the free market. Adopting their approach will result in the same disastrous consequences as has occurred to countries that have adopted socialism and communism.

  

Conclusion

The innovation model that was perfected in the 1990’s was based on three foundations. One foundation was the ability to obtain title to inventions, i.e. patents. Since the late 1990’s a number of changes to the patent laws have decreased the value of patents to an inventor and to an investor. As a result, it is not surprising that inventors and investors have been less likely to invest time and money in developing businesses that require patents to protect their intellectual property. As a result, we have seen innovation in the United States decline, which has effected our economy and our income.

  

Chapter 6: Sarbanes Oxley – The Medicine is worse than the Disease

  

Intellectual capital, financial capital and human capital were the three pillars of the incredible innovation of the 90s. Financial capital consisted of risk capital, particularly venture capital. Generally, the return for investing risk capital occurred when the company had a liquidity event. Liquidity events fell into two general categories: IPOs (Initial Public Offers) or an acquisition. This allowed investors, founders, and key employees to convert some of their equity into cash. While most technology start-up companies in the 90s were acquired as their liquidity event, the ability to go public or sell to another start-up that went public was key to receiving strong valuations. Without these returns from liquidity events, the venture capital or other risk capital sources would cease to exist. The downturn in the stock market starting in 2000 made the proposition of going public unlikely and exposed a number of corporate and accounting scandals.

Sarbanes Oxley was passed in 2002 in reaction to corporate and accounting scandals including those affecting Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, and WorldCom. The legislation set new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards, management, and public accounting firms. The act contains 11 titles, or sections, ranging from additional corporate board responsibilities to criminal penalties, and requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement rulings on requirements to comply with the new law. This law has effectively killed off the possibility of going public in the U.S.

  

Stock Market and Securities History

The Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 1602 became the first modern stock market trading shares of limited liability corporations. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was created by the Dutch East India Company and presumably traded shares in the company. A number of companies in England formed to exploit trade with various parts of the world, including the South Sea Company.[79](#sdfootnote79sym) The South Sea Company was granted a monopoly to trade with South America. In return the company took over England’s national debt from the war of Spanish Succession. The company tried to convince bondholders to exchange their bonds for high priced shares in the company.[80](#sdfootnote80sym) However, the company had to compete with 190 other companies attempting to raise capital in 1720.[81](#sdfootnote81sym) Because of this competition, the South Sea Company [82](#sdfootnote82sym)convinced Parliament to pass the Bubble Act, which made it illegal to establish new companies without statutory authority.[83](#sdfootnote83sym) The South Sea Company’s stock increased almost ten fold in a single year and then collapsed.

While in France, John Law, a Scotsman, started the Banque Generale a private bank that morphed into the central bank of France.[84](#sdfootnote84sym) Law then developed the Mississippi Company, which was granted a monopoly over trade with France’s Louisiana territory and control of its internal affairs.[85](#sdfootnote85sym) Using the banks ability to issue money, Law had the Mississippi Company take over rival trading companies in France. The Company also bought out various tax farming licenses in France. The shares of the Mississippi Company increased almost 20 fold in 1719 and came crashing down in 1720.[86](#sdfootnote86sym) The fall of the Mississippi Company resulted in a collapse of paper money issued by the central bank of France.

France and England both experienced an asset bubble shortly after limited liability stock companies were invented and stock markets to trade shares of these companies started. However, in France the bubble had longer lasting effects because the government granted the Mississippi Company the right to act as the central bank, the treasury department, issue paper money as legal tender and a monopoly over most of France’s trade. The South Sea Company in England was one of many companies competing for investment capital and could not issue paper money as legal tender. The South Sea bubble had little effect on England’s stock market, trust in paper money or foreign investors’ confidence in England’s financial institutions.[87](#sdfootnote87sym) The French lost confidence in the stock market and were leery of paper money for years. This stunted the development of modern financial institutions in France for over a century and contributed to England, not France, becoming the world’s greatest empire in the 19th century.[88](#sdfootnote88sym) France and England both experienced stunning failures as they adjusted to the innovations of modern finance, but France’s response was to reject innovations in finance and England’s response was to learn from the failure and continue to innovate.

The first stock market in the U.S. opened in Philadelphia in 1790. In 1792 twenty four merchants in New York met secretly to form the Buttonwood Agreement. The Buttonwood Agreement stated that the merchants would only trade with each other and set fees for transactions. This became the New York Stock Exchange. The Buttonwood Agreement was named after a buttonwood tree that was the traditional meeting place for the merchants to trade stocks.

A century before, the Dutch constructed a wall to protect themselves from Indians and pirates. The path had become a bustling commercial thoroughfare because it joined the banks of the East River with those of the Hudson River on the west. The path was named Wall Street. Early merchants built their warehouses and shops on this path, along with a city hall**.** The New York Stock Exchange was eventually located at 11 Wall Street. The American Stock Exchange (Amex) began in 1849 with the Curb Exchange and the California Gold Rush. The Amex played an important part in the financial and business transactions associated with the mining industry in the 19th century. The curb brokers gathered around the lampposts and mailboxes, resisting wind and weather, putting up lists of [stocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock) for sale. The stock market in the U.S. was regulated only by common law contract and fraud rules for over a century.

The formative years of the U.S. focused financial regulation on banking, particularly, over whether the U.S should have a national bank. The debate pitted two of America’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.[89](#sdfootnote89sym) Hamilton argued for a national bank, while Jefferson was against a national bank. Hamilton’s plan for a national bank also included a law that the federal government assume the war debts of all the states. The Virginians were against this, since Virginia had paid off most its war debts.[90](#sdfootnote90sym) Hamilton and Jefferson worked out a deal where Jefferson would support the assumption of the states war debts and, in return, Hamilton would support a bill to have the federal government located on the Potomac river in Virginia.[91](#sdfootnote91sym) Hamilton’s central bank was designed to hold the deposits of the federal government, make loans to the federal government, facilitate payments by the federal government and issue paper money.[92](#sdfootnote92sym) The bank would be a private bank, capitalized in part (20%) by the federal government and have both government and private citizens on its board.[93](#sdfootnote93sym) Hamilton believed that a bank run by the government would be tempted print too much money.[94](#sdfootnote94sym) The bank was required to redeem paper money in gold and silver and the federal government accepted the bank’s paper money as payment of taxes.[95](#sdfootnote95sym)

Hamilton’s financial programs converted the U.S. from a financial basket case to a financial powerhouse with the highest credit rating in all of Europe.[96](#sdfootnote96sym) However, Congress did not renew the charter for the first Bank of the United States. As a result, the first Bank of the United States expired in 1811. President Madison was able to charter the second Bank of the United States in 1816 that functioned similarly to the first Bank of the United States. President Jackson ran on eliminating the second Bank of the United States and in 1836 he succeeded. This was followed by the National Banking Act in 1863 which chartered a number of banks as national banks. The Act required that national banks be unit banks that could not operate across state lines.[97](#sdfootnote97sym) As a result of the unit banking rule, the national banks were dependent on a narrow local economy and could not diversify their loan and deposit base. The McFadden Act of 1927 prohibited interstate banking. These rules resulted in numerous (about 9000) bank failures in the U.S. during the depression, while Canada did not have a single bank failure.

Regulation of the securities market began with Kansas’ Blue Sky Law in 1911, which regulated securities offerings and sales to proactively protect the public from fraud. The law was championed by J. N. Dolley, a successful rural banker and republican politician.[98](#sdfootnote98sym) Within eight years 44 states had adopted similar laws. Dolley’s stated motivation was to protect the people of Kansas from unscrupulous stock peddlers. In addition, he argued that the law would keep “Kansas money in Kansas.”

Kansas’ Blue Sky law gave the banking commission broad authority to allow sales of securities in the state.[99](#sdfootnote99sym) The broad authority allowed the commissioner to determine the merit of a security for sale and reject any offering that “does not promise a fair return on the stocks, bonds, or other securities to be offered for sale.”[100](#sdfootnote100sym) During the first year of operation in Kansas the commissioner, Dolley, only approved 7% of the applications for securities.[101](#sdfootnote101sym)

A major motivation for these laws appears to be protectionism, the small local banks did not want to compete for depositors’ money. Many of these laws exempted banking securities from registration.[102](#sdfootnote102sym) Legal challenges to the Blue Sky laws argued they provided overly broad delegation of legislative powers to a regulatory body with no success.[103](#sdfootnote103sym)

Federal securities laws were first enacted during the Great Depression in reaction to the stock market crash of 1929 and the perceived failure of the state’s Blue Sky laws. Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.§ 77a et seq.) which regulates interstate sales of securities (original issues only) at the federal level. It requires that any offer or sale of securities using the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce be registered pursuant to the 1933 Act, unless an exemption from registration exists under the law. This was followed by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.), which created an independent regulatory agency, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC regulates secondary sales of securities including stock exchanges, enforces antifraud provisions, and enforces continuing disclosure requirements for issuers’ of securities. False or misleading statements in any documents required under the 1934 act may result in liability to persons who buy or sell securities in reliance on these statements. Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) in 1935, which limited electrical utility companies to a single state or limited geographic area. PUHCA also prohibited utility holding companies from engaging in unregulated businesses. This law was superseded by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which now allows utility companies to operate across state lines. Several less important securities laws were passed around 1940. The Securities Investor Protection Act was passed in 1970, which created the Securities Investors Protection Corporation (SIPC). SIPC provides insurance coverage up to $500,000 of the customer's net equity balance, including up to $100,000 in cash.

  

Sarbanes Oxley

None of these early securities laws were able to prevent the stock market decline of 2000. Sarbanes Oxley was passed in 2002 in reaction to several corporate and accounting scandals including those affecting Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, and WorldCom.  The legislation set new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards, management, and public accounting firms.  The act contains 11 titles, or sections, ranging from additional corporate board responsibilities to criminal penalties, and requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement rulings on requirements to comply with the new law.

According to John Cogan, Jr., professor of Law and Economics and Harvard:

  

The primary goal of the Sarbanes Oxley Act was to fix auditing of U.S. public companies, consistent with its full, official name: the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002. By consensus, auditing had been working poorly, and increasingly so. The most important, and most promising, part of SarbanesOxley was the creation of a unique, quasi-public institution to oversee and regulate auditing, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). In controversial section 404, the law also created new disclosure-based incentives for firms to spend money on internal controls, above increases that would have occurred after the corporate scandals of the early 2000s.[104](#sdfootnote104sym)

  

The alleged benefits of Sarbanes Banes Oxley, in exchange for the costs of auditing, included:

“Investors will face a lower risk of losses from fraud and theft, and benefit from more reliable financial reporting, greater transparency, and accountability. Public companies will pay a lower cost of capital, and the economy will benefit because of a better allocation of resources and faster growth.”[105](#sdfootnote105sym)

When Sarbanes Oxley was passed, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) estimated the cost of compliance would be $91,000.00 per year for each public company.  The most recent estimates for the cost of compliance are between $4.0 million and $5.0 million per year for publicly traded companies.  The United States has over 18,000 public companies, which means the U.S. spends around $80 Billion a year to comply with Sarbanes Oxley.  How much is $80 Billion a year? It is roughly equal to IBM’s revenues per year, and about the cost of the auto industry bailout.

 Is the cost of this law worth its incredible price?  Has Sarbanes Oxley achieved its goal of protecting investors from fraud?  Sarbanes Oxley has cost the U.S. economy at least $400 billion since it passage.  This is just the direct costs and does not include the opportunity costs, which are most likely substantially higher. The stock market has been flat or declining since its passage.  As a result, it is hard to argue that this legislation increased shareholder value.  The banking scandals of 2008 & 2009 that included Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, American International Group (AIG), Merrill Lynch, and the Bernie Madoff fraud make it impossible to suggest that Sarbanes Oxley has protected investors from fraud.

Sources report that 100 to 200 publicly owned companies per year, including big names such as Dunkin’ Donuts and Neiman Marcus, have chosen to buy out their stockholders and revert to private ownership since Sarbanes Oxley was passed.  Many U.S. private firms are putting off initial public offerings, and more foreign companies are choosing to list on the Tokyo, London or other foreign exchanges rather than on the U.S. stock exchanges.

Sarbanes Oxley has essentially killed off the public market as an exit strategy for technology start-up companies, thereby reducing investment in innovative start-up companies.  In the second quarter of 2008, there were no public offerings of Silicon Valley venture capital-backed companies, a phenomenon not seen since 1978.  At $4-5 million per year for a company to go public and comply with Sarbanes Oxley, a company must have earnings of about $100 million and sales of around $1 billion.  Given these astronomical hurdles to an IPO (Initial Public Offer), it is not surprising that start-up companies no longer consider an IPO a realistic exit strategy. By closing off the public market to start-up companies, the amount of risk capital available (e.g., venture capital) has declined precipitously.

  

Conclusion

Sarbanes Oxley is very expensive: including enormous direct and indirect costs to our economy and to innovation. It has not met its goals of improving the quality of auditing or preventing fraud. Nor have any of the benefits of these costs materialized. Public companies have not experienced lower capital costs, investors have not been protected from fraud and there has not been faster economic growth due to more efficient allocation of resources. The effects of this law include fewer public companies, fewer companies going public, more companies choosing to go public in foreign markets, absurdly high auditing expenses and a significant decrease in risk capital.

Interestingly, a number of econometric studies of the effectiveness of the SEC and securities laws before and after Sarbanes Oxley have shown no net effect on investor returns.[106](#sdfootnote106sym) According to Liu et al. “we find that the conditional mean and variance of monthly total real stock returns were no different

during 1940-2007 than during 1871-1925. Consequently, recent claims by high ranking government officials that stock market “stabilization” requires increased federal regulation implies greater faith in this method of protecting investors than is supported by the evidence.”[107](#sdfootnote107sym) What these studies do not account for is the lost opportunity costs due to all the securities laws. At least in the case of Sarbanes Oxley, the opportunity costs far outweigh the direct costs.

Since the public market is not an option for innovative start-up companies, why don’t risk capital investors and company founders just obtain their return on investment through dividends and salary or alternatively, sell out to another public company? Selling out to another public or private company has been the major exit strategy for most start-ups in the last decade (2000-2009). The problem with this solution is the limited number of companies that can purchase start-ups and generally these companies want to pay for the start-up with their stock. Only when companies that believe their stock is well valued are likely to engage in acquisitions. Because Sarbanes Oxley limits the number of companies in the public market, it limits public stocks that investors can purchase to mature, slower growing companies. As a result, most public companies’ valuation by the market is not high and the amount of money they can pay for a start-up is correspondingly lower.

There are three reasons why dividends and salary are not good substitutes for going public: 1) taxes are higher on dividends and salary than on capital gains, 2) this requires pulling cash out of a company that needs the cash to grow, and 3) the timeframe to obtain the return is ten years or longer than a public offering. Taxes on dividends and salary are at least double the taxes on capital gains. Also, the founders and investors are only taxed when they sell their stock. They may never sell all of their stock, further reducing the tax burden.

When a start-up goes public it infuses money into the company allowing it to grow faster. The investors and founders can use the company’s stock as money instead of withdrawing cash from the company. Since the stock is now publicly traded, the founders can be confident that if they need cash they can sell some of their stock at that time. This reduces their propensity to sell the stock immediately. Venture capital firms can use the stock to pay off their investors or hold, confident that if they need cash they can sell some of their stock at that time. The company can use its stock to purchase other start-ups.

If the founders and investors are limited to salary and dividends for their return and assuming the company would have a ten times multiple on earnings, it would take at least ten years for the founders and investors to obtain the same return. When you add in the additional taxes for salary and dividends compared to going public and the time value of money, it would probably take even longer than ten years to obtain the same return. This would slow the company’s growth by starving it for capital.

How should we reform securities laws to encourage innovation? First, we should repeal Sarbanes Oxley. In the 1990s the U.S. was the innovation leader of the world, state and federal tax revenues were burgeoning, and the stock market was booming. This was the result of a thriving technology start-up ecosystem. Then we passed Sarbanes Oxley and the stock market is down, the U.S. is no longer innovating and federal and state budgets are bleeding. Sarbanes Oxley is a direct attack on the technology start-up ecosystem, starving it for capital.

Since there is no evidence for the efficacy of securities laws, the regulatory burden of these laws should be drastically reduced. Regulation should be limited to requiring quarterly financial statements. The goal of securities laws should not be to create “perfect competition” among investors. Perfect competition is the enemy of innovation, resulting in investor apathy over which stocks they buy. Ultimately, the question is whether the U.S going to choose the path of France after the Mississippi Company collapse and renounce innovation or the path of England after the South Sea bubble and embrace innovation?

Chapter 7: Stock Options – Accounting or Controlling

  

  

Intellectual capital, financial capital and human capital were the three pillars of the incredible innovation of the 90s. Human capital in the form of scientists, engineers, management, etc. was typically lured into a risky start-up company with stock options. According to the online accounting dictionary an option is a right given the holder to buy a specified number of shares of stock at a certain price by a particular date. Stock options were the prize if the venture worked out for talented individuals to forego better paying, less stressful positions with established organizations that often had better benefits. The strike price of the stock option was always set at or below the fair market value of the stock at the time option was issued, meaning the option had no inherent value. The promise was that if the venture succeeded the employees would be able to cash in their stock options and receive a large reward. If the venture failed, these stock options would end up being worthless. Some accountants believed that stock options should have an associated expense at the time of the option grant. The Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) implemented a rule requiring expensing of options in December 2005.

Before delving into the rules of stock options, it will be helpful to first define the role of accounting. Dictionary.com defines accounting as a detailed report of the financial state or transactions of a person or entity. In layman’s terms accounting is the measurement of financial parameters. A key concept in measuring physical parameters is to make sure the measurement system does not disturb the parameter being measured. If the measurement system alters the system being measured, then the user does not know how the system is behaving or how to adjust the system to meet the objectives of the user. Analogously, the goal of accounting should be to measure the financial parameters without altering the business being measured, so the client can make decisions about how they want to run their business. As we will see, the FASB rule on stock options is so complicated and expensive that it alters the entity being measured.

According to an article in the Journal of Business & Economic Research,[108](#sdfootnote108sym) stock options were necessitated by the separation of company ownership and management. Stock options were used to overcome the “agency problem” and tie the interests of management and owners.[109](#sdfootnote109sym) In 1972, the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, defined how to account for stock options. This rule only required expensing stock options that had intrinsic value – in the money options with a strike price below the market value. Between 1985 and 1988 FASB conducted research on stock based compensation programs.[110](#sdfootnote110sym) The conclusion was companies should be required to expense the fair value of stock options, resulting in out of the money stock options being expensed. Many high technology companies criticized the conclusions and FASB received over 200 letters on the issue, most of which were critical of the proposed rule.[111](#sdfootnote111sym) During 1992-1993, FASB again reviewed the issue of employee stock options. They reached the same conclusion as in 1988 and received over 450 letters mainly against the proposed change. Opponents of expensing employee stock options argued that expensing stock options would result in their elimination.[112](#sdfootnote112sym) The other concern was that companies’ earnings per share would be significantly reduced by the extra phantom expense.

Despite this, Congress and the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) applied intense pressure on FASB to change the rule in the early 2000’s. FASB reasserted its position in 2004 that employee stock options without any intrinsic value should be expensed. This time, they received over 6,000 letters mainly against the rule. The critics against expensing stock options included several Nobel Prize winning economists. In December 2005 FASB implemented a rule, statement no. 123, requiring expensing of options. Why did FASB implement a rule that went against the wishes of many of their clients? The accounting profession is supposed to provide financial information for their clients, that the clients believe is useful in running their business. Unfortunately, most accountants do not work for the people that pay them. For instance, if you hire an accountant to help you with your taxes, the law has made it clear that the accountant’s first obligation is to the IRS - not to the client paying them. Today as a result, it is almost impossible to get good tax advice now days. Accountants preparing the books for a publicly traded company have a greater duty to the SEC than to the company paying their bill. Other accountants do DOD (Department of Defense) auditing work or Medicare auditing work. In all these cases the accountant is preparing information for the benefit of a government agency instead of the client. As a result, many accountants do not consider a company’s goals for their accounting system to be important.

Government intrusion into accounting has changed it from a tool for business when making decisions into a government compliance issue. As a result, some CEOs are suggesting that recent changes in the accounting rules, including those relating to stock options, have made it impossible for them to understand what is happening in their own business.[113](#sdfootnote113sym) The goal of accounting should be to measure the financial parameters that businesses find important, not measuring parameters the government believes are important.

Does the expensing of employee stock options make sense economically? Bob Pavey in the November 2002 NVCA magazine points out that employee stock options neither result in a cash cost to the issuing company nor do they result in an opportunity cost. He shows that there is no cash cost to the company by the hypothetical situation where a company with a thousand shares, grants a thousand shares to a new shareholder. The company now has 2000 shares, but its revenues, expenses and assets are exactly the same as they were before the grant. Similarly, granting stock options does not change the cash situation of the company, and the exercising of these stock options does not change the cash situation of the company either. Since there will never be a cash expense associated with the granting of a stock option, why should companies have to

  

include a phantom expense for these options? According to Mr. Pavey, the company has not incurred any opportunity costs since the company has not foreclosed any other equity sales opportunities. The justification used by FASB and proponents of expensing stock options is that they have value to the employees receiving them. If I own the rights to a book with a royalty stream and I assign a portion of that royalty stream to another person, I have not incurred an expense and neither has the book. The assignment of a portion of the royalty stream has value to the other person, but no expense is incurred because of that transaction. Expensing stock options does not make sense logically. This is the same conclusion reached by a UC Berkeley business school position paper in 2006 that was signed by several Nobel Prize winning economists.

Another justification given by FASB for expensing stock options is that it would achieve convergence between U.S. and international accounting standards. Is this a good reason for passing a law/rule? This reasoning has weakened our patent laws and is used here to again attack the foundations of our high technology start-up community.

There is no logical way to determine the value of an employee stock option for a non-publicly traded company. The Black Scholes model is based on an actively traded market for options. In addition, this model was designed for options that are freely traded, while most employee stock options have a number of restrictions. FASB’s solution is to suggest that companies use a lattice model to expense employee stock options. According to Wikipedia:

a lattice model can be used to find the fair value of a stock option. The model divides time between now and the option's expiration into N discrete periods. At the specific time n, the model has an infinite number of outcomes at time n + 1 such that every possible change in the state of the world between n and n + 1 is captured in a branch. This process is iterated until every possible path between n = 0 and n = N is mapped. Probabilities are then estimated for every n to n + 1 path. The outcomes and probabilities flow backwards through the tree until a fair value of the option today is calculated. A simple lattice model for options is the binomial options pricing model.

The lattice model is clearly a very complex method of estimating the unknown and the unknowable. The complexity of expensing stock options has resulted in most start-up companies no longer issuing them. As a result, the FASB rule on expensing stock options fails the goal of accounting - to measure an entity’s financial parameters without affecting them. Washington accountants are dictating how businesses can conduct their business with this rule.

This rule should be repealed. Employee stock options should never be expensed, even when they are “in the money” at the time of grant. Stock options should only be taxed when converted into cash. One of the supposed benefits of an income tax is that liability is only incurred when a person has the means to pay the tax. Presently, stock options are generally taxed when converted to stock. This has lead to some disastrous situations where an employee exercises their stock options and incurs tax liability, but shortly thereafter the stock price crashes and selling all of the stock does not even cover the tax liability. The federal government wants the best of both worlds: to tax non-cash transfers but refusing to accept anything but legal tender. As long as there are legal tender rules, income should only be recognized when an entity receives legal tender.

Chapter 8: Suggestions and Prognostications

  

The incredible innovation and economic growth of the 90s resulted in burgeoning state and federal revenues that held out the promise of paying off the federal debt[114](#sdfootnote114sym) and made the U.S. the envy of the world. The 90’s brought us companies such as Amazon.com, eBay, Netscape, Broadcom, and AOL to name a few.  We discovered web browsers, PDAs, universal email, voice over IP, DSL, broadband cable, cable telephony, Wi-Fi, and TiVo among others. 

By 2009 the U.S. had the second highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression, record federal deficits both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP and very little technological innovation. In the decade of 2000-2009, the U.S. economy revolved around building and remodeling houses using easy credit. In the second quarter of 2008, there were no public offerings of Silicon Valley venture capital-backed companies, a phenomenon not seen since 1978. What happened to U.S. innovation, which is the key to long term per capita income growth?

I have proposed that the high technology start-up market was the victim of little known regulations that eroded the very foundations on which the innovation of the 90s was built. Other explanations that have been posited include; a decline in the inventiveness of American engineers and entrepreneurs, overinvestment in the technology business, and the maturation of technology underlying the Information Age.

The suggestion that American engineers and entrepreneurs suddenly became less innovative is not plausible. There has been no mass exodus of inventors and entrepreneurs from the U.S. There is no reason to suggest that this group would suddenly become less innovative, except for some external market forces. Commonly, entrepreneurs who have success with a technology start-up either begin additional start-ups or fund other technology entrepreneurs. Recent research has shown that great American inventors of the 19th century were highly motivated by the economic opportunities for their inventions.[115](#sdfootnote115sym) In aggregate, inventors and entrepreneurs react to market forces and if they appear to be less innovative than before, there must be some change in the market that occurred.

Another suggested reason for the slow down in American innovation, is that there was overinvestment in the technology sector in the 90s. There is some truth to this assertion. Clearly, there were too many companies that had little to no revenue and had multimillion-dollar valuations. However, Silicon Valley always overinvests in the number of companies pursuing a new area of technology. The effect of this overinvestment is to develop an area of technology faster and find an optimum business model sooner. From the perspective of the overall economy this is actually a good thing, since it accelerates growth and innovation. Obviously, not all these companies can be winners and it would appear at first that the losing companies were a waste of money, but the losing companies help refine the technology and business model. In addition, many of the so called losing companies are bought out by one of the winning companies, so the investment is usually not a complete loss.

The overinvestment in technology companies in the 90s may have taken 2-3 years to be digested by the market. This time would have allowed bad companies to fail and successful companies to be proven out. The success of numerous technology companies in the 90s meant there was more risk capital available for technology start-up companies in the 2000-2004 timeframe than in the early 90s. The downturn in the stock market did reduce the risk capital somewhat. Despite this there was substantial pools of money looking for investment in the 2003-2004 timeframe because of the easy money policy of the Federal Reserve after 911. The overinvestment in technology companies in the 90s does not explain why the technology sector continued in the doldrums as late as 2007 & 2008. In fact, the start-up technology sector performed more poorly as the decade unfolded than in the early and middle part of the decade.

Another potential reason for the slow down in American innovation was that the technology of the Information Age had matured. Economic growth and innovation tend to follow waves of innovation and when the technology behind a wave of innovation matures the economy slows.[116](#sdfootnote116sym) A mature technology by definition has less innovation to be mined or discovered. Most “Long Wave” theorists believe that the Information Age wave has another ten years to go. In addition, numerous innovations were clearly on the horizon in 2000 and still have not been fulfilled. For instance, voice communication was on the verge of becoming free in 2000. Since, 2000 there has been very little progress in bringing down the cost of voice communication. Sending a voice signal takes very little bandwidth and the amount of bandwidth was exploding in the late 90s. Since, 2000 there has been very little expansion of the U.S. bandwidth. For instance, DSL and cable internet were both widely available in 2000. These technologies still deliver about the same bandwidth to the office or home as they did in 2000.

Another promising area of technology in 2000 was the Application Service Provider (ASP) format for software. Most new software companies have gone to this model, where the software developer hosts the software on their servers and the end user just leases the software. This eliminates the upfront cost of purchasing the software, reduces the cost of maintaining the software because upgrades are part of the service and makes the software more user friendly. For people concerned with the integrity of their data, the data can be stored locally. This model is clearly the wave of the future, but has not penetrated the mainstream software market. This is because of a lack of investment in software, not because of a lack of technology or entrepreneurs to pursue it. The technology of the Information Age is not mature, it may be reaching its teenage years but it has a long way to go.

The two main culprits for inhibiting innovation are usually tax and regulatory policy. The Bush administration implemented a number of tax cuts. The lowest income tax rate was lowered from 15% to 10%, the 27% rate went to 25%, the 30% rate went to 28%, the 35% rate went to 33%, and the top marginal tax rate went from 39.6% to 35%. These changes in marginal rates should have spurred the start-up sector and did most likely mitigate the damage to the technology sector. This leaves regulatory policy as the primary candidate as the cause for the slow down in American innovation. As explained throughout this book, the technology start-up model has three legs: intellectual capital, financial capital, and human capital. Changes to our patent laws have made it more difficult to secure and enforce a company’s right to its intellectual capital. Sarbanes Oxley made it almost impossible for a new company to go public, limiting access to financial capital, and the FASB rules on stock options limited the access to human capital by start-ups.

It is interesting to ponder how the economy would have performed if these and similar start-up killing regulations had not been enacted. The Federal Reserve made up its mind around 2000 to cool the incredible growth in the technology start-up market. It raised the discount rate from 4.75% to 6.5% in about a year, despite the fact that the price of gold, one of the most sensitive barometers of inflation, was falling in price. The action of the Federal Reserve along with the overheated market meant that the technology sector was going to experience a slow down around 2000. As so often happens when the government attempts to micromanage the economy, other events interceded. In this case, the events of September 11, 2001 caused the slow down engineered by the Federal Reserve to compound. This resulted in a severe downturn in the technology market. Because of 911, the Federal Reserve had to quickly backtrack and lower interest rates. These lower interest rates encouraged the rapid growth in the housing sector of the economy.

The technology sector did start to recover and was beginning to grow by 2004. This growth in the technology sector would have continued and been as strong as the 90s, but for the innovation killing changes in the patent system, Sarbanes Oxley, and the new accounting rules for stock options. As a result of these regulations, the growth seen in the technology sector in 2004 petered out. Resulting in no public offerings of Silicon Valley venture capital-backed companies in the second quarter of 2008, a phenomenon not seen since 1978.

Despite the weak technology sector, the economy seemed to be growing. Most of this growth was in the housing sector, where the only real innovations were on the financial side. For instance, mortgage backed securities were propelling the cheap credit in the housing market. Mortgage back securities are bonds or other debt instruments created from a pool of residential mortgages. Mortgage backed securities were first created by the Government National Mortgage Association, also called Ginnie Mae, in the 1970s. This role of creating mortgage back securities was taken over by two government backed entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, by the turn of the century.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were created as government sponsored enterprises to increase home ownership in the U.S. by making it easier for people to obtain a mortgage. In order to fulfull their objective, Fannie and Feddie were given special tax and regulatory prividges not available to private investment firms. The mortgage backed securities were assumed to be very safe since they were a pool of mortgages from around the country. This was suppose to insulate these securities from fluctuations in individual housing markets. In fact, a mortgage backed security is suppose to be considerably more secure than any individual mortgage making up the security. These securities were often perceived as being backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, since they were issued by Fannie and Freddie. As a result, the rating agencies (Standards and Poors and Moodys) often gave mortgage backed securities AAA ratiing, the same rating as treasury bonds, which is backed by the U.S. government.

A number of Washington policies encouraged loose lending standards. For instance, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) created hugh liabilities for banks that were accused of discriminating against minorities in approving mortgages. In 1992 the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston published a study claiming to find evidence of discrimination by banks amoung applicants even after adjusting for differences in creditworthiness. This forced banks to lower their lending standards or risk hugh lawsuits. One solution for banks was to just originate loans and then sell them to Freddie or Fannie who would then turn them into a mortgage backed security. In this way, the banks did not hold the loan for more than a couple of months.

When the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates almost to zero, treasury bonds provided almost no yield to investors. As a result, investors around the world went is search of high yeilds with similar risk profiles as treasury bonds. What they found were mortgage back securities that had the same bond rating as treasury securities, but with a yield of 5% or more. This made mortgage securities look very attractive to investors around the world. As a result, the global pool of money demanded more and more of these securities. Fannie, Freddie, investment banks and mortgage brokers responded to this demand by lowering the requirments necessary to obtain a mortgage. Since these securities were bought by investors throughout the world, when the mortgage crises hit the U.S. it effected the whole world.

Why didn’t someone notice the risks building in the mortgage market? A number of people did recognize the dangers including Alan Greenspan who warned that Fannie and Freddie needed more regulation. Several politicians also made faint complaints about needing more oversight of Fannie and Freddie. In the political climate of 2004-2006 the Democrats were loath to criticize their programs that were so successful in obtaining home ownership for low income and minority applicants. Additionally, Fannie and Freddie were often revolving doors for Democrats as a reward for their service in congress. The Bush adminstration was reluctant to tighten lending standards, since the housing market was the only part of the economy that was growing. The bond rating agencies were under tremendous political pressure not to blow the whistle on the party. According to the book _Meltdown_ by Thomas Woods, Jr., the bond rating agencies are a SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) created cartel and have to worry about upsetting their political masters. The politicians were clear that they wanted the party to continue. The housing bubble was built on government mismanagement; from the market distoring agencies of Fannie and Freddie, to the threat of litigation against banks, and the fraud perpetuated by the bond rating agencies that mortgage backed securities were as safe as treasury securities.

If the U.S. had not stunted the growth of the start-up technology sector, would it have made any difference in how the economy played out in 08 & 09? Without the innovation killing regulations, the technology sector would have added to the economic growth since 2000. This would have diverted investment from the housing sector into the technology market and curtailed some of the worst abuses in the home mortgage market. Investors would not have been so single focused on mortgage backed securities as the only game in town. A growing technology sector would have delayed any large scale home foreclosure problems, since more people would have been employed creating innovative enterprises. The mortgage crises would still have occurred, but it would have been less severe. The severity would have been lessed by the stronger economic growth, by redirtecting investment dollars from the mortgage market, and by having fewer people employed in the housing sector.

  

Recommendations

Presently (8/09) there are two major proposals to change our patent laws. One is the Patent Reform Act being considered by congress, the other is a proposal by President Obama to change the term for pharmaceutical patents from twenty years to seven years. The Patent Reform Act is a further attempt to weaken our patent laws. President Obama’s plan to shorten the term for drug patents would kill innovation in pharmaceuticals.

Pat Choate’s article, _Patent Reform is ‘Anything’ But_ [117](#sdfootnote117sym)completely debunks the present patent reform proposals.  So what would real patent reform look like?  Here are ten real reforms that will increase innovation and spur economic growth.

  

**1.** **Double the Funding of the PTO**

The absurd length of time, 2 to 5 years depending on the area of technology, and the outrageous cost necessary to obtain title (a patent) to one’s invention is a national disgrace.  If it took this amount of time and cost to obtain title to real property, we would assume you were discussing some corrupt third world country.  The pedencacy goal for the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) should be no more than 1.5 years and the first Office Action in a patent application should occur within six months of filing.  Doubling the USPTO’s budget would be a good start.  Funding for the USPTO can be pulled from transportation projects.  This would be a drop in the bucket for the pork laden transportation federal budget.  An aggressively funded patent office results in real innovation and real increases in per capita income.

  

**2.**  **Regional Offices for the USPTO**

The USPTO is located in Arlington Virginia, next to Washington D.C., where the cost of living is expensive and the 9000 government employees have little significance to the state of Virginia.  By having one or more offices in Denver, Portland, Seattle, Austin, Minneapolis, etc. or some combination thereof, examiner retention rates are likely to significantly increase, since the cost of living is lower.  The pool of qualified, English speaking applicants, for patent examiners would increase, since the USPTO has admitted they have a hard time keeping examiners who are not from the northeast.

The USPTO mission is about promoting technology and it makes sense that the USPTO should be located near the centers of technology, not the center of political power.  By having the USPTO near great centers of innovation, examiners are will obtain a better understanding of the underlying technologies they examine.  Locating the USPTO in multiple congressional districts increases the likelihood it will remain fully funded.

A patent attorney friend of mine from England, Brian Lucas, stated they had tried something similar in the UK.

Some years ago the UK Patent Office was moved from central London to Wales (which, as far as I was concerned) was in the middle of nowhere.

At the time I thought this was a terrible decision but I now realize that it was one of the best administrative decisions I have seen.

In particular the Central London Patent Office was facing staffing difficulties and I frequently had dealings with temporary staff who had little or no experience of the patent system and who were rarely able to help me. Once the Patent Office moved to Wales I rapidly found that I was dealing with a stable group of highly experienced, extremely knowledgeable and very friendly people who are an absolute pleasure to work with.

  

This shows that the UK has had success with a similar proposal.

  

**3. Repeal the eBay and KSR decisions**

The eBay decision denied patent holders their basic right to exclude others from using their invention.  Since the only rights a patent gives the owner is the right to exclude, the courts must enforce this or a patent is of no more value than a blank piece of paper.

The KSR decision overturned 20 years of jurisprudence developing an objective standard of patentability.  KSR’s subjective standard of patentability decreased the value of patents, increased the likelihood of litigation – since no one can objectively tell if a patent is valid, and increased the cost and time associated with obtaining a patent.  The KSR decision is inconsistent with the constitutional purpose of patents to promote technological innovation and protect inventors from intellectual property thieves.

  

**4.**  **Patent Reciprocity**

If you drive your car across the border into Canada you do not lose title to your car.  If you take your manuscript across the border into Canada you do not lose the copyright to your manuscript.  But, if you take your invention across the border into Canada, you lose your patent protection and anyone can steal the invention – not the physical embodiment, but the underlying invention.

Patent reciprocity would automatically provide patent rights in a foreign country when you obtained a patent in the U.S. and vice versa.  This idea was first proposed by the U.S. in the mid 1800s according to B. Zorina Kahn’s book “The Democratization of Invention: Patents and Copyrights in American Economic Development, 1790-1920“. Unfortunately, the idea died and since then patent rights have been part of the convoluted process of trade negotiations.

Patent reciprocity would significantly increase the value of patents and increase the value of research and development.  As a result, it would spur investment in innovation.  Reciprocity would increase the valuation of technology start-up companies in all countries that participated.  It would also increase per capita income.

  

**5.** **Repeal Publication Requirement**

The publication rule is a clear violation of the social contract between the inventor and society.  Under the publication rule, society gets the advantage of the disclosure of the invention even if the inventor never receives any property rights in his invention.  Before the publication rule if an inventor felt that the scope of the claims to his invention were too narrow or not allowable, he could withdraw his application and keep his invention a trade secret.  Narrow claims are easy for a competitor to design around providing little protection in exchange for the disclosure of the invention.  In other words if the inventor did not like the deal he was offered from the Patent Office he could reject it and keep his invention a secret.  Even for inventions that can be reverse engineered once the invention is marketed, this is a better deal than the publication rule.  Under the publication rule, it is easy for competitors to find the inventor’s idea on the World Wide Web and copy the invention.  Without publication, a competitor has to spend the time and money to reverse engineer the invention.  This is significantly more costly than reading a patent application that describes the invention in “enough detail that one skilled in the art can practice the invention.”  35 USC 112.  The publication rule is perhaps the most egregious anti-patent change in the patent laws in the history of the U.S.  It does not promote the useful arts, since it decreases the incentive to file for a patent, which also decreases the diffusion of knowledge by the patent system.  The ability to opt out of publication if the inventor promises not to seek foreign patent rights, does not restore the social contract.

The US should demand the repeal of publication from foreign countries if they want reciprocity under our patent laws.

  

**6.** **Accelerated Patent Court**

A new court similar to the ITC (International Trade Commission) that has expertise in patents and accelerates the patent litigation process is needed.  The court should be sufficiently funded and have procedures that allow patent cases to be resolved in under a year.  Perhaps the court would be limited to issuing injunctions as a remedy as opposed to economic damages.  The goal of this new court is to establish the US. as the premier arbiter of patent rights.  The U.S. is the best positioned country to protect patent rights, despite our recent history.  This would increase the U.S.’s standing as a technological leader in the world and draw innovative companies and people to the U.S.

  

**7.** **Eliminate Maintenance Fees**

Maintenance fees are a backhanded way of introducing a “working requirement” to patents.  Working requirements for patents have been always been rejected in the U.S.  These fees favor large entities and reduce the effective life of patents.  There are no working requirements or maintenance fees for copyrights.  Why should inventors be treated so poorly in relation to authors?  Copyrights do not require a complicated, overly formalistic, application process and last almost forever.  There is no justification for treating inventors as less worthy of legal protection than authors.

A strong patent system pays for itself several times over in increased tax revenues from increased economic activity.  The supply side returns from a strong patent system probably exceed the return resulting from lowering the capital gains tax.

  

**8.** **Gene Patents**

No patent should issue for claims directed to genes that occur in nature.  However, those created by man clearly deserve patent protection.

  

**9.** **Reduce Formalism in PTO, Doctrine of Equivalents, Restrictions**

The patent system has become overly formalistic.  Restrictions are required for trivial differences that are embodiments of the same inventive idea.  The doctrine of equivalents has been dead for over a decade.  Formalism over logic rules in the realm of inequitable conduct.  35 USC 101 issues related to software inventions also place form over function that require absurd recitations to computer hardware.  All of these formalistic requirements favor patent thieves at the expense of real innovators.

  

**10.** **Eliminate the allowance rate as measure of quality**

The USPTO tracks individual examiners’ allowance rates.  Low allowance rates are correlated with more rigorous examinations by the patent office.  (see U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General, “USPTO Should Reassess How Examiner Goals, Performance Appraisal Plans, and The Award System Stimulate and reward Examiner Production”, Final Inspection report No. IPE-15722/September 2004).  As a result, examiners feel a perverse pressure to have a lower allowance rate than their cohorts.  Low allowance rates are the result of arrogant government bureaucrats, who want the patent system to be an elitist system.  This is not in keeping with the history and goals of the US patent system.  This elitist attitude does not spur innovation and retards economic progress.

As one patent examiner explained in early 2009:

I believe that the allowance rate is artificially low, although not due to churning…at least not exactly.

I am a current examiner. Under Dudas (John Dudas former director of the USPTO), the PTO pursued a policy of “increased patent quality”. The way that the PTO enforced this quality initiative was by reviewing office actions. Not reviewing all office actions, mind you, but only reviewing allowances.

Unfortunately, the PTO failed to see the problem that they were setting up. An examiner is then left with two choices:

1) An examiner could generate rejections without ever incurring quality review, or  
2) An examiner could generate an allowance that would be scrutinized by quality review and possibly find themselves assessed a quality review error.

So, it has been safer for an examiner to always reject…at least until very recently. There has been some loosening of the allowance quality review rules in recent weeks as it appears that “reduced pendency” is the new key motivation under Obama.

  

These reforms are critical to changing the legal environment from one of passive acceptance of innovation to encouraging it.

At the time of this writing the Supreme Court has agreed to review the Bilski case, 545 F.3d 943, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2008), with potentially major implications for our patent system. Many observes believe that this case will have major implications for software and business method patents.  The Bilski patent application covered a method of hedging risks when trading commodities.  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) ruled that the Bilski patent did not fall within the subject matter of patentable material.  It reached this decision based on the so called machine or transformation test.  Bilski did not recite a machine or transform matter from one state to another state according to the court.

Software patents are inherently directed to a machine.  As any electrical engineer knows, solutions to problems implemented in software can also be realized in hardware, i.e., electronic circuits.  The main reason for choosing a software solution is the ease in implementing changes, the main reason for choosing a hardware solution is speed of processing.  Therefore, a time-critical solution is more likely to be implemented in hardware, while a solution that requires the ability to add features easily will be implemented in software.  As a result, to be intellectually consistent, those people against software patents also have to be against patents for electronic circuits.  Unless the Supreme Court is going to hold that electronic circuits are not statutory material for patents under 35 USC § 101, their decision should not affect software patents.

Some people in the open source community argue that the difference between software and hardware, is software can be reproduced at virtually no cost.  This argument is incorrect.  Software code, which is the instructions, can be cheaply reproduced if the computer hardware already exists for the copying.  The executed code or process cannot be reproduced cheaply, since it inherently requires hardware.  The hardware can only run so many processes at one time and is limited in speed and power.  Patents do not cover the software code, they cover the executed code or process.

The CAFC’s Bilski decision results in an overly formalistic style of claim writing that requires hardware be recited in the claims, when the exact hardware implementing the software is irrelevant to the invention.  For instance, error correction codes used in computers and communications are extremely important to our information society.  Error correction codes transform a set of numbers (data) into another set of numbers (a code).  The data and code are then transmitted to another location where the data is transformed and compared to the received error correction code.  The patent claims and the patent specification do not need to recite the hardware by which the error correction system is implemented for an electrical engineer to understand the system.  In fact, most technical and text books on coding do not refer to the underlying hardware.  However, under Bilski, if the inventor does not recite some hardware then his claims will fail the machine or transformation test.  What is the risk to the patent system if the inventor does not recite the hardware for an error correction code?  An error correction coding scheme divorced from hardware is useless.  No one is going to compute error correction codes by hand.  The requirement to recite the hardware is absurd and the most likely outcome of this rule is to deny a patent to a deserving inventor.

One of the first cases stating that methods of doing business are not patentable related to a patent covering outdoor drive-in movie theaters, _Loew’s Drive-In Theatres v. Park-In Theatres,_ 174 F.2d 547, 552 (1st Cir. 1949).  The claims covered the now well-known design for a drive-in movie theater.  Clearly, these claims were directed to real world objects and there relationship.  For instance, how does one setup the parking rows in a partial semi circle around a screen and run the speaker systems to the cars?  The drive-in theater was a major success with over 800 drive-in theaters in 1948.  The drive-in theater did not exist before Richard Hollingshead, the inventor, created it.  Despite this, the court ruled that methods of doing business were not patentable and invalidated Mr. Hollingshead’s patent.  A process for building a car, an airplane, or a radio are methods of doing business and yet no one would question that they are patentable.  A process for curing rubber is also a method of doing business.  All of these processes are part of how a company conducts its business, i.e., a method of doing business.  There is no support in the statute, 35 USC § 101, for a prohibition against business method patents.

According to many people, one of the best known business method patents is the Amazon one click patent.  Amazon.com applied for the patent in 1997 and it issued in 1999 as patent number 5,960,411.  A number of competitors had copied Amazon’s one click ordering system and shortly after the patent issued, Amazon.com sued Barnes and Noble for infringement.  Industry studies showed that between sixty and sixty-five percent of online shopping baskets abandon before they checked out.  The primary reason for abandoned internet shopping carts seems to be buyer confusion and annoyance with the online purchasing process.  Presumably, many of those abandoned shopping carts represent lost sales.  The goal of the one click method for online shopping was to make the process simpler, faster, and more secure, thereby capturing some of that lost business.  Barnes and Noble’s Express Lane (one click shopping system) was evidently successful, since a large percentage of their customers had chosen to utilize the Express Lane rather than the shopping basket.  Amazon’s one click patent clearly involved software and therefore hardware, in order to have any meaning.  The hardware included the internet, the customer’s computer, and Amazon’s servers.  Amazon.com used real technology to solve a real problem.  This is exactly the sort of invention our patent system is designed to protect.  

A logically consistent definition of business method patents does not exist.  All patents are related to a method of doing business, since even device patents are related to how the business intends to build the device.  A common category of business method patents the critics decry are e-commerce patents, such as the Amazon.com one click patent.  All these patents use real technology (internet, computers and software) to solve real world problems.  Patents for financial products have also been widely criticized as business method patents.  If the financial product uses computers (software) to implement the product, then it uses a machine.  The fact that the machine merely transforms data, usually relating to money, makes it no different than a patent relating to error correction codes.  In an information society the processing and transformation of data is central to the economy and its technology.  The telegraph and telephone are nothing but devices to transform and transmit information.  The sounds wave created at the receiving end of the telegraph and telephone are just one more step in transferring the information.

The Supreme Court should reverse the Bilski decision requiring the “machine or transformation” test.

  

Sarbanes Oxley and Securities Law

How should we reform securities laws to encourage innovation? First, we should repeal Sarbanes Oxley. In the 1990s the U.S. was the innovation leader of the world, state and federal tax revenues were burgeoning, and the stock market was booming. This was the result of a thriving technology start-up ecosystem. Then we passed Sarbanes Oxley and the stock market is down, the U.S. is no longer innovating and federal and state budgets are bleeding. Sarbanes Oxley is a direct attack on the technology start-up ecosystem, starving it for capital. In the second quarter of 2008, there were no public offerings of Silicon Valley venture capital-backed companies, a phenomenon not seen since 1978.

Since there is no evidence for the efficacy of securities laws, the regulatory burden of these laws should be drastically reduced. According to Liu et al. “we find that the conditional mean and variance of monthly total real stock returns were no different during 1940-2007 than during 1871-1925. Consequently, recent claims by high ranking government officials that stock market “stabilization” requires increased federal regulation implies greater faith in this method of protecting investors than is supported by the evidence.”[118](#sdfootnote118sym) The goal of securities laws should not be to create “perfect competition” among investors. Perfect competition is the enemy of innovation, resulting in investor apathy over which stocks they buy. Regulation should be limited to requiring accurate quarterly financial statements. Beyond this, standard tort remedies are sufficient for a well regulated stock market. This does not mean fraud will never occur, only killing the stock market can achieve this. Access to public capital is critical for innovation, given the incredible costs involved in creating and distributing new technology.

  

Stock Options

The FASB rule requiring that stock options be expensed should be repealed. Employee stock options should never be expensed, even when they are “in the money” at the time of grant. Expensing stock options is a phantom cost, with no basis in reality. Stock options should only be taxed when converted into cash. One of the supposed benefits of an income tax is that liability is only incurred when a person has the means to pay the tax. Presently, stock options are generally taxable to the holder when converted to stock. This has lead to some disastrous situations where an employee exercises their stock options and incurs tax liability, but shortly thereafter the stock price crashes and selling all of the stock does not even cover the tax liability. The federal government wants the best of both worlds: to tax non-cash transfers but refusing to accept anything but legal tender. As long as there are legal tender rules, income should only be recognized when an entity receives legal tender.

Stock option are critical in attracting talent to risky start-up companies. The exercise of stock options filled state and federal coffers in the 90s. The government shot themselves in the foot with this regulation.

  

Conclusion

Innovation is the key to economic growth. Patent law is the cornerstone of government policy on innovation. Alternative systems, such as direct government grants to inventors have been tried and are much more expensive and significantly less successful in spurring technology. Capital is a necessary part of creating and diffusing new technologies. Sarbanes Oxley has severely restricted access to capital. People with expensive skills are critical to technology start-ups. The FASB rule on stock options destroys their incentive to be part of a start-up.

These changes to our regulations are not politically risky, involve only minor costs to the federal budget to implement. and will result in tremendous dividends to our economy. The experience of the early Bush-II administration shows that pursuing innovation policies may be a more effective way to get the economy growing than tax policy. If the U.S. were to implement the regulatory changes suggested in this book, it would probably be the fastest method of restoring growth to the economy. These reforms would allow the U.S. to deal with the coming crises due to the bankruptcy of Medicare and Social Security. These reforms will not solve these intergenerational thievery schemes or allow us to ignore them, but it will provide a less painful path for solving these issues.

When we start protecting our innovators’ intellectual property and celebrate their accomplishments, we will know that the U.S. is once again serious about being the innovation leader of the world.

[37](#sdfootnote37anc) Despite numerous claims to the contrary, the U.S. was not based on Judeo Christian principles. Natural Law is based on reason not faith and the Declaration of Independence is a restatement of Natural Law. Judeo Christian principles had existed for over 18 centuries before the innovation explosion associated with the industrial revolution. There is no evidence that Judeo Christian philosophy encourages innovation.

[38](#sdfootnote38anc) Note that the US has tried the opposite of socializing the costs, but keeping the returns private. For instance, the US K-12 educational system is tax funded but the student keeps the returns on their education. Another example is the recent (2008) banking scandals where any profits were kept by private investors and any losses were born by the taxpayer.

[56](#sdfootnote56anc) No attempt is being made for a rigorous correlation between patent attitudes and economic performance. This is because policies often lag attitudes and the effect of policies is not immediately reflected in the economy. In addition, a number of other variables confuse any analysis, such as the US was the only industrial country whose production facilities were essentially left intact after WWII and this contributed significantly to the US economy in the 1940s. Despite this, there is clearly a general correlation between general patent attitudes in the country and its economic and technological performance.

[67](#sdfootnote67anc) Because of this, it is incorrect to state that a patent is a monopoly. A legal monopoly is a right to a market and includes both the exclusive right to sell into that market and the right to exclude others from selling into that market. A patent does not confer the right to a market or the right to sell the patented invention.
