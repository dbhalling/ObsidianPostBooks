The whole "business Method" patents drive me crazy. First, I don't like the term because I do not believe there is any logical consistent definition for it. Second, everything is subject to laws of nature - you are either inside the laws of nature or you are outside the laws of nature, logically. Take the One-Click patent. It relies on computers, communication systems etc. all employing principles of laws of nature. We have become so abstracted from the basics that as lawyers and judges that sometimes we forget the foundations. For instance, many people believe software inventions are not relying on the laws of nature, but software is just a way of wiring a circuit diagram. So software patents are really electronic circuit patents. Many so called business method patents are the application of software to problems of business, which means they are really electronic circuit patents. They deal in information (dollars) but so do error correction codes, DNA diagnostic tests, etc.

As scientists and engineers, patent attorneys should agree on at least agree on the two points: 1) you cannot create something from nothing (conservation of matter and energy) so all inventions are combinations of known elements/steps and connections (112 requires this) and 2) All inventions are within the laws of nature - we are not patenting magic.
