Global Warming (AGW) is a hypothesis that man’s emission of CO2 and other green house gases are changing the temperature here on Earth. AGW koolaid drinkers suggests that this is all science, but as a person with a Masters degree in Physics, and undergraduate degree in electrical engineer and thirty years working on the cutting edge of technology I know this is not science but religion. Let’s look at some of their lies, frauds and deceptions.

  

1) AGW models do not explain why Earth has Ice Ages and yet it expects us to believe they can predict future climate changes. This does not meet Thomas Paine’s criteria. Clearly they are making an extraordinary claim, namely that they can predict the future of Earth’s climate without being able to even explain the past climate on Earth.

  

2) Why did Al Gore and friends ignore (lied about) the Little Ice Age in the 1600s to support their claims of AGW. Is that science?

  

3) AGW advocates push the idea that there is a consensus of scientists that support (drank the Koolaid) of AGW. However, science is not about consensus. Did Galileo have a consensus of scientists supporting his view that Earth rotating around the moon, when he presented his idea? Did it make him wrong? There are thousands of highly respected scientists (include physicists, chemists and climatologists) who have pointed out that the so-called science of AGW is nonsense, but they are ignored. (Here is one example [http://www.endoftheworld2012.net/20100210%2031000%20Scientist%20disagree.pdf](http://www.endoftheworld2012.net/20100210%2031000%20Scientist%20disagree.pdf)) Is this science?

  

4) AGW advocates are the same people who said we were headed for a new Ice Age in the 1970’s. When a group of people have been consistently wrong, how can they meet Thomas Paine’s criteria?

  

5) The first IPCC report did not conclude that AGW was likely, it was the political hacks that put that in, not the scientists. Is that science?

  

6) Increases in weather events such as hurricanes – repeated by Obama just the other day and clearly proven wrong over and over and over again – but the AWG people keep repeating the lie – As Goebbels said repeat a lie often enough and people will believe it is the truth. Is that science?

  

7) AWG koolaid drinkers have predicted an increase in temperature, this increase has failed to occur. This problem also occurs because the biggest increase in temperatures of the last two hundred years were before there was large scale outputs of CO2 by humans. Also CO2 increases tend to lag not lead increases temperature. When the temperature increases it is AGW according to the koolaid drinkers, when it doesn’t it is still AGW according to the koolaid drinkers. Is this science?

  

8) When the data did not fit the models, the AWG people blamed the data and then massaged the raw data to fit their theory. See Al Gore hockey stick curve, Climate Gate, etc. People who have to lie about the data are not practicing science, they are practicing religion.

  

9) Melting of the Polar Ice Cap will cause severe flooding. IF the polar ice cap melts completely it will not raise the level of the ocean one millimeter – its floating ice. This scare story has been dropped by AGW koolaid drinkers because it was so stupid, but shows they have an agenda that is not science.

  

10) Polar bears are losing their habitat and going extinct according to AGW koolaid drinkers. Actually, the number of polar bears continues to grow.

  

11) The Greenland ice mass is going to be completely melted in several decades according to AGW koolaid drinkers. The fact is that Greenland’s ice mass is increasing.

  

12) Out of 117 climate models being used, 114 overestimated the amount of warming and the other three were close to the correct answer. If this were science you would have expected a roughly equal amount of over and under prediction. Is there bias in the models?

  

13) Note this just begins to scratch the surface of the number lies told by the AGW advocates.

  

  

AGW is based on lies and fraud. AGW IS RELIGION AND THE KOOLAID DRINKERS ARE ITS DISCIPLES

  

ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE CONSISTENTLY WRONG AND EVIL

  

1) Environmentalist pushed the idea that DDT was a terrible carcinogen and killing off birds of prey. They were wrong in both cases and their actions resulted in the deaths of over 100 million people.

  

2) Environmentalist killed nuclear power, with irrational fears. What if the half life of the by-products were infinite? This has resulted in the deaths of over 600,000.

  

3) Environmentalist pushed the idea of the ozone hole in Antarctica, but the science clearly showed that this was just a natural phenomena of lack of sunlight in the Antarctic winter. Is this science.

  

The goal of AGW is to kill capitalism and as a result kill millions of people. Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace explained. (Environmentalism today is) more about globalism and anti-capitalism than it is about science or ecology…
