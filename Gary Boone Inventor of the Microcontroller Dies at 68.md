Gary Boone invented the microcontroller while working at Texas Instrument in the early 1970s. I had the good fortune to know Gary Boone in the later part of his life, he had brilliant mind and was good friend. It is sad day for the electronics industry and my heart goes out to his family.

  

IEEE did an Oral History with Gary that was lost for over a decade. You can see the agility and brilliance of this great inventor’s mind in the interview. Please read the whole oral history [http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Gary_Boone](http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Gary_Boone). Mr. Boone has a number of interesting insights in the interview. For instance, he states that he invented microcontroller while at Texas Instruments because of boredom. He was working in a group designing custom Integrated Circuits (ICs). While designing these chips he began to feel “I’m tired of doing this. I’m working long hours. My family is not happy. I have to find a better way of doing this.” He also noticed that the basic requirements for all these projects were similar and this led to the idea that a general chip that was programmable could solve multiple customers’ requirements. He also discusses the resistance in the community to this innovation.

  

After inventing the microcontroller, he moved to a start-up company, Litronix, that made handheld calculators. The company was not aggressive about filing patents. An overseas competitor was able to drive Litronix out of the market because of the differential tax rates, U.S. regulatory rules on consumer warranties, and their weak patent portfolio.

  

Because Mr. Boone was the inventor of the microcontroller, he ended being involved in numerous patent lawsuits. This has caused him to have a unique perspective on the patent system. One of the most interesting points he makes is that design teams often fail to review the patent literature before starting the design process. Because of this, they often reinvent designs and reviewing patent literature results in better designs.

  

Gary will be missed by all that knew him.
