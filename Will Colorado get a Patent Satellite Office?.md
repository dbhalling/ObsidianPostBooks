CBS Denver [http://denver.cbslocal.com/2011/09/18/denver-a-finalist-for-new-patent-office/](http://denver.cbslocal.com/2011/09/18/denver-a-finalist-for-new-patent-office/) is reporting that Denver is in the running for one of three patent satellite offices. However, this likely to be a Pyrrhic victory even if Denver is selected. In all probability Congress will not pass a budget, which means that they will pass a continuing resolution bill that will freeze the Patent Office’s budget at 2010 levels. The user Fees from the Patent Office will be stolen (diverted – in Orwellian terms) and there will not be enough money to setup a satellite office in Denver.
