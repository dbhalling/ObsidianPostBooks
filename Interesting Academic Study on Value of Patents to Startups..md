This paper has some interesting points, HIGH TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURS AND THE PATENT SYSTEM: RESULTS OF THE 2008 BERKELEY PATENT SURVEY [http://www.rmsclaw.com/resources/ssrn-id1429049%5B1%5D.pdf](http://www.rmsclaw.com/resources/ssrn-id1429049%5B1%5D.pdf).

  

_We also report that for many startup companies, patents are an important part of the mix of strategies used by them to capture competitive advantage from their technology innovations. But this important role tends to be much more pronounced among biotechnology and “hardware” companies (including both medical hardware such as surgical devices, and IT hardware, such as computers and semiconductors) than among software and Internet startups._

_While having intellectual property increases the probability of success, those who manage intellectual property well have an even higher probability of success. In certain sectors, such as healthcare, data demonstrates the value of higher quality portfolios. In other sectors, such as telecommunications or information technology, the effect is less prominent – although still clearly and demonstrably present._
