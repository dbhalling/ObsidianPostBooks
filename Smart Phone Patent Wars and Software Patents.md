Two economists from the US Patent Office attempt to bring facts and perspective to the smart phone patent litigation and to the issue of software patents. The paper, _Of Smart Phone Wars and Software_

_Patents_ [http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.27.1.67](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.27.1.67) starts with a literature survey on the general question of whether patent promote innovation and the economy. It progresses to discuss the history of ground breaking technologies and the US patent system. Next it looks at the quality of the patents being litigated in the smart phone cases. Finally, it examines the question of whether software patents receive different treatment at the PTO. It appears to be a fairly balanced article, but

In fact, fair examination of the available evidence

shows that the smart phone patent wars are not about low-quality software patents, shows that the smart phone patent wars are not about low-quality software patents,

nor about errors in software patent examination or issuance.
