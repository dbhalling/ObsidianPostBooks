The definition of what is patentable cannot exclude inventions that are combinations of existing elements and connections. First, conservation of matter (matter and energy) means that no one creates something from nothing.  In addition, if you applied for a patent suggesting you had a “totally new” item in your invention you would receive a rejection from the Patent Office (USPTO).  Assume your “totally” new item was called “Novel-X”.  Since the examiner at the USPTO would not know what “Novel-X” is, they would reject your patent application as “indefinite” under 35 USC 112, second paragraph.  This part of the statute states: The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. 35 USC 112, second paragraph.

Novelty is defined as a claim that defines a set of elements and connections that are not found in any one reference. If the patent office or court cannot find a single prior art reference with the same set of connections and elements combined in the same way, it is clearly a new item. In the words of the law, “A rejection for anticipation under section 102 requires that each and every limitation of the claimed invention be disclosed in a single prior art reference.” _In re Paulsen_, 30 F.3d 1475, 31 USPQ2d 1671, 1673 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Nonobviousness is defined as a claim that defines a set of elements and connections that two or more relevant prior art references do not show the same elements and connection combined in the same manner. The key part of this statement is “relevant” prior art. Because of conservation of matter, see above, it is always possible to find a group of references that show the elements and connections. If this keeps an invention from being patentable, then nothing patentable has ever been invented and we might as well close down the patent office. In the words of the law, “Its logic is the fallacious logic which leads to the conclusion that since each of the words in Lincoln’s ‘Gettysburg Address’ were individually old and well known at the time he used them, it would have been obvious for anyone of ordinary skill with a dictionary before him, to have written it.” _In re Dailey and Eilers_, 357 F.2d 669, 149 USPQ 47 (CCPA 1966).

A relevant prior art reference is one that is directed to the same problem or at least in the same area of technology. In the words of the law, In order to rely on a reference as a basis for rejection of the applicant’s invention, the reference must either be in the field of the applicant’s endeavor or, if not, then be reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor was concerned. _In re Oetiker_, 977 F.2d 1443, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
