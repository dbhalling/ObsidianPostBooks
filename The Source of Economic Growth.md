While economic growth is flagging all over the world, notably in Europe and the United States, Dale Halling explores the _Source of Economic Growth_ in his new book. Halling zeroes in on innovation, particularly the patent system, as the key to economic growth, and explores why the massive increase in government regulations and weakening of the patent system, as well as the current academic climate, are all taking us in the wrong direction. Halling argues forcefully that we must encourage innovation and the patent system if we want to prosper or risk falling into a Malthusian trap of low growth and stagnation—or worse.

Philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand, the founder of objectivism, had painstakingly pointed out just how critical the role of the human mind is, in the very act of human survival and of the flourishing of the human race. Yet, it is the concept of _intellectual property_ that is under attack today, not only from progressives and Marxists, but also from anti-IP libertarians, whom Halling shows us to be the “imposter defenders” of liberty.

Economic science as taught in universities has long degenerated into outright fraud. But even Classical and Austrian strands, while, in some cases, comprehensive in their critique of the deleterious effects of government interference in the economy, including that of central banking, generally ignore the pivotal role of invention in economic growth. Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) is not, in fact, a theory of growth in as much as it is a theory of what NOT to do, of _laissez faire_ (leave us alone).

Halling, himself an inventor and patent attorney, is a passionate defender of an inventing culture, and of enshrining _intellectual property_ at law.

In a short (30K words) but wide-ranging and vigorous treatise, Halling comes up with a much-required exposition, both of the role of inventing in economic growth, and of the legal framework necessary to embellish _intellectual property_ rights at law. In doing so, he fills a gaping hole in economic science by outlining a theory of economic growth that integrates with the philosophy of objectivism.

The last chapter, Chapter 14, has him conversing with a fictional Mr. Farnsworth, a visitor from a utopian near future. Whatever you do, don’t skip or skim over this one. It is an entertaining, concrete vision of where we can get to, if only we heed the advice embedded in this wonderful book.

Dale Halling provides an insight into the nature of wealth creation. Merely working harder, or even more efficiently, provides a diminishing return. Indeed, for most of human history until recently, man rarely beat this challenge. It is invention, which Halling carefully defines, that enables us not only to escape the trap but also to soar as high as our minds will take us. A worthwhile read for students of the human condition.

_Source of Economic Growth_ by Dale Halling examines the rarely discussed origin of economic growth. Completely different from Keynesian economics and somewhat different from the Austrian economic approach, Halling examines how America's founding views on intellectual property and low taxation allowed it to prosper far faster than the rest of the world. Without the proper incentives in place and the appropriate protections of patents, copyrights, and trademarks, the inventions that are the key to improvement in the quality of life will never occur. One particularly intriguing analogy is made between economics and thermodynamics. Halling argues that, in the absence of invention, economic behavior equilibrates fairly quickly. As when living things harvest light or other forms of energy, to move away from a state of maximum entropy and minimum energy, invention provides a disturbance in the governing differential equations of economic transactions that leads to a new, improved steady state until the next invention, competition, or government intervention disturbance takes place.

# Preface

This book is about the most important question in economics: What is the source of economic growth? It is concerned with real per capita increases in wealth or income, which is what matters to most of us. Surprisingly, very little attention has been paid to this question by the economics' profession. I will survey the history of thinking on this subject by economists.

There has been significant empirical study of economic freedom. This work shows the wealthiest countries are those with the greatest economic freedom. However, this has not been incorporated into a school of economic thought. One of the questions raised by these studies is why countries with lower economic freedom ratings (sometimes much lower) have economic growth rates that are two or more times greater than the growth rates for the most economically free countries. This book explains why that occurs and why economic freedom is connected with economic success.

The book is roughly divided into three parts of unequal length. The first part is directed to what economists call new growth theory. The second part of the book is directed to the area called bioeconomics or thermoeconomics and starts at Chapter 11, Entropy, Evolution, Economics. It provides a deeper understanding and broadening of the thesis developed in part one. The third part combines all into a school of economic thought that I label intellectual capitalism.

I will answer a number of key questions including: What is the source of real per capita economic growth?; Why did the Industrial Revolution start when and where it did?; Why is economic growth associated with economic freedom?; and How are economically less free countries able to have higher growth rates than more economically free countries?

Chapter 1 provides a quick overview of the thesis of this book.

Chapter 2 provides an overview of what economists throughout history have said is the cause of real per capita economic growth.

Chapter 3 explains that inventions are the source of all real per capita increases in wealth.

Chapter 4 discusses how most of the common definitions of the study of economics are misleading and provides an alternative definition.

Chapter 5 shows that property rights for inventions were critical to increasing the rate of invention so that large numbers of people could escape the Malthusian trap.

Chapter 6 provides a review of the historical evidence for patents being the key property right for economic growth.

Chapter 7 examines some of the academic arguments against patents.

Chapter 8 examines the arguments over whether patents are property rights.

Chapter 9 is an overview of scholars who have examined the process of invention.

Chapter 10 lays out six natural laws of invention.

Chapter 11 discusses how our accounting systems fail to recognize the economic value of inventions and how to fix this.

Chapter 12 shows the relationship between entropy, evolution and economics.

Chapter 13 examines whether inventions are subject to diminishing returns.

Chapter 14 provides the foundations of a school of economics that incorporates the insights from examining the source of all real per capita increases in wealth.

Chapter 15 is an imaginary interview with a person from the future fifty years after the policies suggested by this book have been implemented.

No school of economics is currently consistent with natural rights, which was the founding principle upon which the United States legal system is built and, therefore, its economy. Natural rights are also the underpinning of most, if not all, 19th century common law countries. This book proposes a school of economic thinking that is consistent with natural rights. As used herein, natural rights is the logical system that starts with the axiom that you own yourself.

There is some repetition because the author wanted that section of the book to stand on its own or because the concept has been so distorted in present dialogs that it was necessary to clarify the issue. Where concepts are addressed that have been so distorted in current dialogs of thought, definitions will be reinforced for clarification.

The book provides some footnotes. Because of the Internet, the structure and purpose of footnotes are changing. As a result, I have decided that the formal rules on the structure of footnotes are antiquated and no longer serve their purpose.

# Chapter 1: Thesis

Humans are different from every other organism on Earth in that they alter their environment to meet their needs while organisms alter themselves to adapt to the environment. The way man does this is he uses his mind to create inventions that will solve a problem of his existence. Throughout history, the rate at which new inventions were created was relatively slow and the increase in the standard of living of the inventor and those around him was quickly swamped by increases in population and the effects of diminishing returns. For instance, the advent of agriculture made the first farmers wealthier since farming took less than a tenth of the land to support each person.[1](#sdfootnote1sym) However, increases in human population and declining fertility of soil quickly swamped this effect, and the result was a larger, but not wealthier, population. Historically, population increases and diminishing returns have combined to ensure that people lived on the edge of starvation, which is commonly referred to the Malthusian trap.

This situation of stagnant, subsistence levels of per capita wealth lasted until a small group of English-speaking people started the Industrial Revolution around 1800. Then, for the first time, a significant part of the population was able to escape the Malthusian trap even with a rapidly increasing population. This short history of the economy of man raises two of the most important questions in economics: 1) What is the cause of real per capita increases in income? and 2) Why did a relatively small group of English-speaking people suddenly break out of the Malthusian trap when they did? Strangely enough, neither of these questions has received significant attention from the economics profession.

We have already answered the first question. The only way man can alter his environment to increase his standard of living is to create new inventions. However to increase his standard of living he has to create new inventions that increase his wealth at a rate faster than increases in population and diminishing returns deteriorate his wealth.

This book defines economics in a slightly different way than most of the economics profession. Economics is the study of how man obtains those things he needs for his survival. This definition avoids the disembodied idea of resources and makes clear that resources must be created by people before they can be distributed or consumed.

The reason the Industrial Revolution, which should be called the Invention Revolution, started with English-speaking people, is that they were the first to provide large numbers of people the opportunity for property rights in their inventions, commonly known as patents. As noted by the economist Hernando de Soto and many other economists, property rights are the key to maximizing the output from a resource. The most important resource is man’s mind’s ability to create new inventions to improve our lives

Adam Smith published his famous treatise on economics, _An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,_ in 1776, which is considered the start of the study of economics. It is important to note that he was writing about the wealth of nations, not the wealth of people. Smith was skeptical that large groups of people would ever escape the Malthusian trap. In the 239 years since Smith published _The_ _Wealth of Nations_, we have gone from inventing the steam ship, to the steam-powered train, to the car, to airplanes, to jets, to spaceships that have left the solar system. In the 240 years before Smith published _The_ _Wealth of Nations_ there were very few new inventions. The moveable type printing press (in Europe) had been invented over three hundred years earlier, and most people still could not afford a book. James Watt had just invented his improved steam engine, which was used to pump water from coal mines, but steam-powered ships and steam-powered trains had not been invented. Some of the inventions necessary for creating inexpensive cloth had been invented, such as the spinning jenny, but the cotton gin had not been invented, and all of these machines relied on human power or water wheels. Practical sewing machines were not available for another seventy years. Smith and most modern economists confine their research to a technologically stagnant economy. Most of modern economics relies on the _ceteris paribus_ (all other things being equal) assumption, which includes no new technologies. However, the most important questions in economics revolve around the creation of new technologies.

If you had told Smith in 1776 that the median person’s real income in the United Kingdom would grow by a factor of 60 and by a factor of 88 for the American colonists over the next 240 years, he would have questioned your sanity. If you told him this would occur while the world’s population expanded by over 8 times and that 86% of world population would escape the Malthusian, he would have been sure that you should be committed to an insane asylum. After all, real per capita median wages had never changed in history, and the population of the world had expanded by just 1.5 times in the preceding 250 years before _The_ _Wealth of Nations_.

This book explains how this occurred and what policies are necessary to ensure that this trend continues.

  
  

# Chapter 2: Introduction: History of Economic Thought on Economic Growth

The single most important question in economics is: What causes economic growth? Surprisingly, very little attention in economics has been directed to this question. In this chapter, we will take a quick tour of economic thought about growth from Adam Smith to the leading new growth economic theorists.

Adam Smith, the father of economics, suggested three ways in which the annual output of a country could be increased.[2](#sdfootnote2sym) First, is an increase in the population, second is the division of labor, and third is “some addition and improvement to those machines and instruments which facilitate and abridge labor.”[3](#sdfootnote3sym) This book is concerned with the causes of real per capita economic growth, which improves the life of the average person, not the “wealth of a nation.”

There are places with high population densities that are very rich and some that are very poor. There is no support in the modern world for any correlation between population or population density and per capita gross domestic product (GDP).[4](#sdfootnote4sym)

The second factor Smith mentions is division of labor. Smith provides the following example to prove his point:

To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture; but one in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of the pin-maker; a workman not educated to this business (which the division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands; though in others, the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor and, therefore, indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are, in a pound, upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations.[5](#sdfootnote5sym) (Emphasis added)

Smith provides three reasons why division of labor increases wealth: “a) improves the dexterity of the worker; b) allows the worker to save the time necessary to switch among different activities; c) puts the worker in the condition of inventing machines to facilitate his job.”[6](#sdfootnote6sym) Improving the dexterity of workers would certainly make them more efficient at their work, but there are clearly limits to this. Once everyone is at peak dexterity, growth would stop. Present management theory is emphasizing cross training among employees, rather than greater and greater specialization. Smith’s second reason, saving time in switching between tasks, has the same limitations as his first reason; it reaches a limit and growth stops. His third reason, inventing, overlaps his “some addition and improvement to those machines and instruments which facilitate and abridge labor.” We will cover inventions in much more detail later in this book. More generally, there certainly is a positive correlation between the division of labor and per capita GDP, but the problem is one of cause and effect. Is division of labor the result of a technologically sophisticated economy or does an advanced economy result because of the division of labor? Smith recognizes that there are limitations to the division of labor based on the size of the market.

As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market. When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he has occasion for.[7](#sdfootnote7sym)

Smith’s argument suggests that a larger population would provide more incentive for the division of labor and there does appear to be some evidence for this, but there is no evidence in the modern world for increased population causing increased per capita income.

Smith was part of the group of classical economists that included David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus. In classical economics, the inputs to the economy are land, labor, and capital.[8](#sdfootnote8sym) Technological progress was seen to be a function of capital accumulation. Smith postulated a continually decreasing return on capital, which will eventually lead to a stagnant economy.[9](#sdfootnote9sym) Malthus is famous for his statement that human population would always grow faster than the food supply. Malthus is often derided by free market proponents, but he was right for all of human existence until about the time he made this statement. In the 1800s, only a small part of the world population was able to escape this Malthusian trap. Even today, about 14% of the world’s population lives at this level, the Malthusian trap, when people live on the edge of starvation. All animals (organisms) live in this state, except man. Malthus’ idea turned out to be a key insight into evolution.[10](#sdfootnote10sym)

Ricardo and Malthus are credited with discovering the principle of diminishing returns.[11](#sdfootnote11sym) This dooms humans to subsistence living in the long run according to these economists. Ricardo was of the opinion that new inventions might provide short-term increases in people’s standard of livings, but these would be temporary.[12](#sdfootnote12sym) David Walsh, in his book _Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations: A Story of Economic Discovery,_ suggests this pessimism by Ricardo and Malthus was the result of the Napoleonic Wars.[13](#sdfootnote13sym) It is not surprising that economics was named “the dismal science.”

By the time John Stuart Mill writes his economic treatise, _Principles,_ in 1848, it is no longer possible to ignore the progress (increases in real per capita income) resulting from the Industrial Revolution. His solution is to propose the steady state economy.[14](#sdfootnote14sym) The economy would grow until it matured. This preserved the concept of diminishing returns, but without the depressing fall back to the Malthusian trap. When the economy reached its peak or steady state, then everyone could relax. The steady state economy would be characterized by roughly equal wealth across the population and if not, then wealth redistribution would make it so.[15](#sdfootnote15sym)

The Austrian School of economics has not been highly interested in the question of the causes of economic growth, instead focusing on the causes of the business cycle. But Ludwig Von Mises did tackle this question, and his answer was free markets, which lead to increases in productivity resulting in high savings rates that facilitate new technologies and entrepreneurs that increase productivity.[16](#sdfootnote16sym) Why do free markets lead to increases in productivity? Why do high savings rates result in new technologies? His answer ultimately is capitalism, but Mises fails to explain what it is about capitalism that causes economic growth. It is like a doctor saying cancer is caused by the uncontrolled growth of cells without explaining why these cells have uncontrolled growth.

Joseph Schumpeter’s answer to the cause of economic growth was creative destruction in which new businesses introducing new technologies destroy older businesses using older less efficient (or otherwise less desirable) technologies. Creative destruction suffers similar problems as Mises’ explanation without even the explanation of free markets. The new businesses are motivated by the prospect of obtaining high profit margins according to Schumpeter but, presumably, this was always the case. What starts this cycle and why did it, the Industrial Revolution, start in England and the US? Why did it not start elsewhere and what policies encourage this? The ultimate question that neither Mises nor Schumpeter answers is: How does this overcome diminishing returns?

John Maynard Keynes introduced the idea of central planning to macroeconomics and turned the economic profession on its head by arguing that private savings was bad for the economy, and somehow consumption created economic growth. There has never been any evidence for Keynes’ position. Keynes was not really concerned with economic growth, but in “optimizing” the economy like it was some sort of internal combustion engine. The eventual result of this was the introduction of the mathematical techniques of quantum mechanics into economics.[17](#sdfootnote17sym) These techniques have solved a number of optimization problems, but have nothing to say about what causes economic growth.

The next step in growth theory was the Harrod-Domar model. This model states the rate of economic growth in an economy is dependent on the level of saving and the capital output ratio, where the capital output ratio can be thought of as the return on capital. This model is a small variation on the classical economics formulation that increases in capital cause economic growth. This model fails to explain why real per capita suddenly takes off, why this occurs in the US and England, or how it overcomes diminishing returns.

The first real advance in modern economic growth theory was by Robert Solow, who won the Nobel Prize in economics because of his work in this area. His model suggests that 87.5% of the economic growth of the U.S. during the middle of the 20th century is the result of technological progress. His paper “Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function” was about total GDP, not increases in real per capita GDP.[18](#sdfootnote18sym) Solow argues technology growth is exogenous, which means it just happens and is independent of economic policy, like some sort of background radiation. Solow’s model did not explain why certain countries progressed faster technologically resulting in significant real per capita economic growth and other countries did not. Solow is a Keynesian and has tried to graft his results into this framework, including preserving the idea of perfect competition.

Paul Romer is the standard-bearer of the endogenous growth theory movement in modern economics. Endogenous growth means that economic policies can affect the rate at which new technologies are developed and, therefore, economic growth rates.

Romer explains his thesis as, “Human history teaches us … that economic growth springs from better recipes, not just from more cooking.”[19](#sdfootnote19sym) Romer seems to use the term “recipes” for inventions, knowledge, or technology and cooking as manufacturing. He carries the cooking analogy further.

Economic growth occurs whenever people take resources and rearrange them in ways that are more valuable. A useful metaphor for production in an economy comes from the kitchen. To create valuable final products, we mix inexpensive ingredients together according to a recipe.[20](#sdfootnote20sym)

Without new recipes, we would run out of ingredients (natural resources), according to Romer.[21](#sdfootnote21sym) "Every generation has perceived the limits to growth that finite resources and undesirable side effects would pose if no new recipes or ideas were discovered. And every generation has underestimated the potential for finding new recipes and ideas. We consistently fail to grasp how many ideas remain to be discovered. The difficulty is the same one we have with compounding: possibilities do not merely add up; they multiply.”[22](#sdfootnote22sym)

According to Romer, there are essentially an unlimited number of potential inventions. He uses the following example to illustrate this point:

On any conceivable horizon — I’ll say until about 5 billion years from now, when the sun explodes — we’re not going to run out of discoveries. Just ask how many things we could make by taking the elements from the periodic table and mixing them together. There’s a simple mathematical calculation: It’s 10 followed by 30 zeros. In contrast, 10 followed by 19 zeros is about how much time has elapsed since the universe was created.[23](#sdfootnote23sym)

Someone might object that Paul Romer overstated the number of possible chemical inventions since not all elements are able to bind chemically to each other. On the other hand, this calculation only includes one of each element. Some of our most important chemical compounds contain long chains of carbon and silicon atoms. In addition, the elements can bond to each other in multiple ways, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds. Elements may also have double, triple, and quadruple bonds. Plus, chemical elements are three dimensional, not a simple linear permutation. When you add in all these variations, Romer has seriously underestimated the number of possible chemical inventions. This calculation is only for chemistry. When you consider computer networks or electronic circuits with billions of transistors in a single microprocessor or nodes, the number of different possible connections is n(n-1)/2 or easily equal to the number of combinations described for chemistry.

Another example that Romer uses to illustrate the unlimited number of possible combinations is all the possible bit streams you can turn into a CD-ROM. The number is something in the range of 10 to the power of 1 billion, which virtually ensures that we will never run out of software to discover. He notes that there is not enough mass in the universe to make that number of CDs.[24](#sdfootnote24sym) Romer’s answer to the problem of diminishing returns is new recipes. But what policies does he suggest will cause the creation of new recipes?

Romer takes sort of a backward way of explaining what policies he thinks lead to growth. First, he shows it is not about capital or natural resources.

Thinking about ideas and recipes changes how one thinks about economic policy (and cows). A traditional explanation for the persistent poverty of many less developed countries is that they lack objects such as natural resources or capital goods. But Japan had little of either in 1950 and still has few natural resources, so something else must be involved.[25](#sdfootnote25sym)

Next, he explains how third world countries can grow. All they have to do is adopt the recipes that have already been created. He explains that many third world countries have policies that limit the adoption or dispersion of modern technology.

But car firms in India operate in a government-created protective time warp. The Hillman and Austin cars produced in England in the fifties continue to roll off production lines in India today. India's commitment to closing itself off and striving for self-sufficiency has been as strong as Japan's commitment to acquiring foreign ideas and participating fully in world markets. The outcomes—grinding poverty in India and opulence in Japan—could hardly be more disparate.

For a developing country like India, enormous increases in standards of living could be achieved merely by letting in the ideas held by companies from industrialized nations.[26](#sdfootnote26sym)

However, countries with advanced economies cannot advance by adopting the technologies of other countries.

But leading countries like the United States and Canada, and new leaders like Japan, cannot stay ahead merely by adopting ideas developed elsewhere. They must also offer incentives for the discovery of new ideas at home, and this is not easy to do. The same characteristic that makes an idea so valuable—everybody can use it at the same time—also means that it is hard to earn an appropriate rate of return on investments in ideas. The many people who benefit from a new idea can too easily free-ride on the efforts of others.[27](#sdfootnote27sym)

There have been two broad systems for encouraging the development of new technologies: 1) property rights for inventions, i.e., patents, and 2) rewards or prizes for inventors. Romer is ambivalent about patents. Romer makes the distinction between physical property, which is rivalrous, and inventions, or recipes as he calls them, which are non-rivalrous.[28](#sdfootnote28sym) He claims:

With ideas, you have this tension: You want high prices to motivate discovery, but you want low prices to achieve efficient, widespread use. You can't with a single price achieve both, so if you push things into the market, you try to compromise between those two, and it's often an unhappy compromise.[29](#sdfootnote29sym)

Romer likes the incentive patents provide for creating new inventions.[30](#sdfootnote30sym) However, he believes that it slows dissemination of new technologies and results in monopolistic competition. He further states: “Because everybody can use the idea at the same time, there's no tragedy of the commons in the intellectual sphere. There's no problem of overuse or overgrazing or overfishing an idea.”[31](#sdfootnote31sym) Romer’s statement is misleading as it applied to inventions and patents. As soon as the invention is realized in a physical form, then the invention is subject to the same scarcity issues as any other good or service. The total market for an invention is limited (scarce) at a particular point in time, and the goods and services necessary to realize an invention in its physical form are scarce.[32](#sdfootnote32sym) When the infringer of a patent makes the invention, he reduces the market value of the invention to the inventor. Patent law recognizes that ideas cannot be overused by too many people knowing about them, and it encourages the spread of ideas by publishing inventions that are patented. A primary goal of a patent system is the spread of technical information. Before modern patent systems, people and companies kept their inventions secret because this was the only way to ensure they profited from their discoveries instead of their competitors. In the U.S., our patent system created a number of patent depository libraries to encourage the spread of technical information. It is one of the requirements of patents that the information on how to “practice the invention” is part of the quid pro quo for receiving a property right for your invention. Specifically, 35 USC 112 states:

The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.

Romer’s statement that ideas are not subject to the tragedy of the commons is misleading in another sense also. One of the problems with commons is that when no one owns a resource, no one invests in the resource—or at least, they underinvest in the resource. A system of property rights for inventions is not the unhappy compromise that Romer suggests. It encourages the spread of information about inventions, and it provides incentives to both create new inventions and to invest in the dissemination of inventions. Romer implies that it takes no resources to disseminate new inventions:

There are some kinds of ideas where, once those ideas are uncovered, you'd like to make them as broadly available as possible, so everybody in the world can put them to good use. There we find it efficient to give those ideas away for free and encourage everybody to use them. If you're going to be giving things away for free, you're going to have to find some system to finance them, and that's where government support typically comes in.

Let me give an extreme example. Oral rehydration therapy is one of those few ideas which did actually jump immediately from science to consumer benefit. It's a simple scientific insight about how you can save the life of a child who's suffering from diarrhea. Literally millions of lives have been saved with it. So what price should you charge people for using it?

Because everybody can use the idea at the same time, there's no tragedy of the commons in the intellectual sphere. There's no problem of overuse or overgrazing or overfishing an idea. If you give an idea away for free, you don't get any of the problems when you try and give objects away for free. So the efficient thing for society is to offer really big rewards for some scientist who discovers an oral rehydration therapy. But then as soon as we discover it, we give the idea away for free to everybody throughout the world and explain "Just use this little mixture of basically sugar and salt, put it in water, and feed that to a kid who's got diarrhea because if you give them pure water you'll kill them." So with ideas, you have this tension: You want high prices to motivate discovery, but you want low prices to achieve efficient, widespread use.

Mr. Romer’s example is misleading. It takes real resources to spread new technologies and information. If there were no scarcity for the adoption of technology, we would expect that in the absence of intellectual property rights new technologies would be adopted instantly and universally. Scientific principles are not subject to intellectual property rights. Calculus was discovered over 300 year ago and is not the subject of intellectual property rights. Despite this, only a small percentage of the population understands it, even in the most advanced economies. Those people who do understand calculus generally paid an instructor to learn this area of math even though books on the subject can be reviewed free at many libraries. Almost everything a student learns through formal education, even in graduate school, is information that is freely available. Even if the textbook is copyrighted, the information is usually available in a non-copyrighted form or available free from a library. Despite this, the U.S. spends over $500 billion per year on all forms of education.

According to venture capitalists, most start-ups will spend 2-10 times the amount on marketing (disseminating) their inventions than on developing them. If the distribution of ideas were free, not subject to scarcity, this would clearly be unnecessary.

University professors, doctors, lawyers, engineers, judges, marketers, sales people, and computer scientists are mainly in the business of distributing or implementing known information. If distributing information is free, not subject to scarcity, then all these people should either be thrown in jail for fraud or paid less than the average day laborer.

The U.S. has historically provided the strongest legal protection for inventions.[33](#sdfootnote33sym) The U.S. is not only the leader in the creation of new technologies but has had the fastest adoption and most widespread diffusion of new technologies. Countries that had or have weak patent laws are associated with the slowest adoption and diffusion rates for new technologies.

Paul Romer is fairly vague on his solution to encourage the creation of new recipes. He seems to suggest the government should fund research and development more aggressively and then give away the recipes. Romer is a Keynesian in the mathematical mold that uses the tools of quantum mechanics to analyze the economy. Like Solow, he tries to graft his insights about the technology driving the economy with Keynesian concepts including pure and perfect competition. This leads to one of his complaints about patents that they lead to monopolistic competition. As most Keynesians, he sees a bigger role for government while recognizing the potential problems of government inefficiencies. He is ambivalent about intellectual property rights and patents more particularly. He likes the incentive they provide to create new technologies, but finds them inefficient based on a perfect competition analysis for the dissemination of inventions. (Perfect competition will be discussed in much more detail in Chapter 6.)

# Chapter 3: Inventions as the Source of Economic Growth

One of the common themes for most economists who have explored the question of economic growth, from Adam Smith to Paul Romer, is that new technologies or inventions are a source of economic growth and the most recent evidence is that inventions (increasing levels of technology) are the source of all economic growth. Unfortunately, Romer uses the somewhat vague term _recipes_ and Solow was rather indefinite in what he meant by technical change, which he also called _the residual_. In order to avoid this sort of confusion, I will define an invention as a human creation that has an objective result, i.e., the effect of which is demonstrable repeatedly, measurable objectively, and independent of the observer. For instance, the invention of an incandescent light bulb has the objective result of putting out light when the appropriate electrical signal is applied. Note that inventions are always about a class of objects, not an individual object (instance). While art is a human creation that has a subjective result, the effect of which is the reaction of the observer, which not only varies from observer to observer, but may also vary over time in the same observer. For instance, the movie _Casablanca_, my reaction will be different from your reaction. Art does not have an objective result. This can become confusing because movies are an invention. A specific movie is a human creation with a subjective result while the class of objects called movies is an invention; actually, a modern movie is a combination of many inventions. Note that a piece of art, such as the movie _Casablanca_, is also a class of objects. There are multiple videotapes, digital copies, and even film copies of _Casablanca_. Art and inventions together are the complete set of human creations.

Manufacturing is distinct from invention and is the process of recreating an invention. If I produce a hundred bikes, I have recreated the invention of a bicycle a hundred times. If I re-engineer a bike to make it smaller for a child, it is still a bicycle. Neither of these meets the definition of an invention; they are reproduction. (The Appendix, Inventions and Art, has more detail on this subject).

With these definitions in hand, does it make sense logically that inventions are the source of economic growth? Man is a rational animal.[34](#sdfootnote34sym) This means that man’s defining characteristic is his ability to think, and he uses his rational faculty to create things (inventions) that increase his chance of survival.[35](#sdfootnote35sym) Man is not the strongest animal, not the fastest, does not have the strongest jaws, or sharpest teeth. He is not best adapted to extreme cold or heat, does not breed the fastest, and yet man is found almost everywhere on Earth. The only way to explain the success of Homo sapiens is their ability to reason. We do not create things to improve our lives just by thinking about them; they must be implemented physically. For instance, the knowledge of how to produce a fire by itself does not cook your food, heat you, or keep wild animals away unless you use the knowledge to create a fire.

Our level of technology defines our standard of living. Imagine if we suddenly had the same technology our ancestors had in 1600. Would we be any wealthier than they were? You might think that we are stronger and live longer. But why would we be stronger or live longer when we have the same food sources, the same medicine, the same shelter, the same sanitation as our ancestors from 1600? We would not. Our technology defines our standard of living.

Inventions are the creation of new technologies that allow us to solve a problem of human existence. For instance, the electric light is an invention to make light less expensive, which allows us to work later, see what we are working on, resulting in fewer errors, and allows us to read and study at night. Production also provides us things for our survival, but it has an upper limit. Once every farmer has a steam tractor, producing more steam tractors will not result in farming that is more productive. Only inventions (new technologies) can continue to increase real per capita income.

  
  

# Chapter 4: Definition of Economics

This book is about economics. Before we go any further, I think it is important that we define the term. There are actually a number of definitions. Here is a sample from Wikipedia:

The philosopher Adam Smith (1776) defines the subject as “an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, in particular as: a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objective of providing] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people ... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services.”

J. B. Say (1803), distinguishing the subject from its public policy uses, defines it as the science _of_ production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.

John Stuart Mill (1844) defines the subject in a social context as: “The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth, in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object.”

Alfred Marshall provides a still widely-cited definition in his textbook _Principles of Economics_ (1890) that extends analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level: Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.

Lionel Robbins (1932) developed implications of what has been termed "[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject": Economics is a science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.

Robbins describes the definition as not _classificatory_ in "pick[ing] out certain _kinds_ of behaviour" but rather _analytical_ in "focus[ing] attention on a particular _aspect_ of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity."[36](#sdfootnote36sym)

I think Say’s definition and Robbins' are the best, but still fail to capture the essence of economics, which, in this book, is defined as the study of how man obtains those things he needs to live. I have three justifications for this definition. One of the reasons we engage in the economy (e.g., manufacture, sell, trade, invent, market) is we need things in order to survive. I will not distinguish between subsistence living and thriving because every study shows that longevity is closely tied to your wealth and the wealth of the country in which you live. Two, I think this definition is more useful in focusing our attention on the source of economic growth. Three, this definition focuses on the individual. As a result, it preserves Robinson Crusoe economics, or that economics applies to a man on a deserted island, which is useful for examining a number of economic concepts including the source of economic growth.

My definition does not specifically mention scarcity or resources. Part of the reason for this is that scarcity can be confused with the idea that economy is a zero-sum game. Resources sound like they are just lying about the street, as if anyone could pick them up, and ignores that these so-called resources have to be produced, mined, distributed, invented, etc. Resources are not just lying about, and the economy is not a zero-sum game. The definition in this book is clear that man must use effort to obtain those things necessary for life, so this definition does preserve scarcity correctly interpreted. As well, it incorporates the idea of resources if correctly interpreted. Comparing it to Say’s, this book’s definition includes the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth, but also includes invention and focuses on why this is necessary.

Applying this definition, Robinson Crusoe engages in activities to obtain the things necessary to sustain his life, so he is a proper subject for the study of economics. For example, fishing is production. He also makes economic trades. For instance, if he goes fishing today he cannot build a house, plant a field, collect firewood, or invent. Crusoe has to decide among all these possible activities and decide what is most beneficial for him. If he chooses incorrectly, he will be poorer or even die. All of these are economic activities; the only difference is that he does not trade, which is the only reason for money. Now, if Crusoe uses a sharpened stick to hunt fish, his skill may improve over time but at some point the number of fish he can catch per day will reach a maximum. But, if he invents a fishing net, the number of fish he can catch will increase by orders of magnitude. Now, he will be wealthier, even if he was catching enough fish to feed himself before. He can either catch more fish and dry them to eat later or he can use the extra time to build a better shelter or dig a well or irrigation ditch. If we add more people to our economy, it does not change the fact that without inventions there is no way to increase real per capita wealth.

# Chapter 5: Patents, Property Rights for Inventions, are the Key to Economic Growth

Hernando de Soto has shown that the key to unlocking the power of assets is legal property rights. “The core of the capitalist system, as I understand it, is that it is essentially a legal property system,” argues de Soto. Making assets fungible by making them legal could unblock trillions of dollars in “dead capital.”[37](#sdfootnote37sym) The story of the Pilgrims illustrates this point clearly. Originally, the Pilgrims tried a collective with communal farms and communal distribution of their products. The result was that they almost starved. The next year, 1623, they decided that each family would own their parcel of land. The result was greatly improved productivity from the same land.

This change, Bradford wrote, had very good success, for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been. Giving people economic incentives changed their behavior. Once the new system of property rights was in place, the women now went willingly into the field, and took their little ones with them to set corn; which before would allege weakness and inability.[38](#sdfootnote38sym)

This natural experiment has been repeated many times. Property rights in assets result in significantly improved returns from those assets.

Since inventions are the source of economic growth, it only makes sense that if you want to increase economic growth you will provide property rights for inventions. Inventions, in many ways, are similar to undiscovered minerals. Without property rights, no one has the incentive to explore for these minerals and once found, to spend the money to extract them. A rational person trying to acquire those things necessary to improve their life is not going to expend much time on creating an invention when they cannot get a return on their time and effort. There is a tragedy of the commons for inventions and it is the failure to exploit this resource without property rights, similar to the tragedy of the commons that happens when people cannot acquire rights in the minerals they discover. The historical alternative to property rights in inventions has been some sort of prize, stipend, annuity (sort of like a poet laureate), etc., which we will call cash prizes. Next, we will examine the historical evidence for the effectiveness of these methods of encouraging the creation of new inventions.

# Chapter 6: Historical Evidence

The first known patent law was in Venice, which passed the Patent Decree of 1474.[39](#sdfootnote39sym) The statute is reproduced below:

WE HAVE among us men of great genius, apt to invent and discover ingenious devices; and in view of the grandeur and virtue of our City, more such men come to us from diverse parts. Now if provision were made for the works and devices discovered by such persons, so that others who may see them could not build them and take the inventor’s honor away, more men would then apply their genius, would discover, and would build devices of great utility and benefit to our Commonwealth.

Therefore:

BE IT ENACTED that, by the authority of this Council, every person who shall build any new and ingenious device in this City, not previously made in this Commonwealth, shall give notice of it to the office of our General Welfare Board when it has been reduced to perfection so that it can be used and operated. It being forbidden to every other person in any of our territories and towns to make any further device conforming with and similar to said one, without the consent and license of the author, for the term of 10 years. And if anybody builds it in violation hereof, the aforesaid author and inventor shall be entitled to have him summoned before any magistrate of this City, by which Magistrate the said infringer shall be constrained to pay him [one] hundred ducats; and the device shall be destroyed at once. It being, however, within the power and discretion of the Government, in its activities, to take and use any such device and instrument, with this condition however that no one but the author shall operate it.[40](#sdfootnote40sym)

There were other pseudo patent laws in Europe after the Venice Patent Decree. I label them as such because they were not directed at protecting the rights of inventors, but in acquiring inventions from other countries. England slowly developed an archaic patent system, starting with the Statute of Monopolies of 1623. But it did not effectively protect inventors’ rights until about 1800. The United States and the colonies had patent systems roughly modeled on England’s. The (original) US Constitution only mentions one RIGHT and that is the rights of inventors and authors, i.e., patents and copyrights. It was not until the Patent Act of 1836 that the US created the first truly modern patent system. A modern patent system is characterized here by an examination system administered by an independent professional examination corps that is readily accessible to all inventors (as opposed to only wealthy or politically connected inventors, see England in the 1800s), has a system for widely publishing patents, and provides a freely alienable property right. An effective patent system was not available for a large number of people until around 1800.

Most likely, there were prizes, salaries, etc. for inventors on an informal basis going back to at least ancient Greece. It is very difficult to gather much information about these systems. We will leave the question of the effectiveness of these cash prizes for stimulating inventions until we get to modern times.

Did people invent before patent laws were created? Absolutely. Patents are not required for people to invent, and this appears to suggest that there is some exogenous component to inventions. However, it would be outrageous to suggest that none of these inventors intended to profit from their inventions. Many intended to profit from their inventions by keeping them secret. The Middle Ages were characterized by trade guilds that kept inventions trade secrets, which allowed members of the guild to profit from them. Also, some inventors may have gained enough profit from using the invention in their own operations to justify the investment, even if other people were able to copy their invention.

What was the rate of invention before patent systems? Economists have studied this question. For instance, Michael Kremmer studied the rate of technological change from one million BC to 1990 and found that the rate of invention is mainly determined by population.[41](#sdfootnote41sym) There also appears to be some relationship between population density and the rate of invention. His explanation is that the chance of someone creating an invention is roughly uniform across the population. As a result, the rate of inventing is higher in larger populations, and the cost of disseminating the invention is less for larger population groups. His model clearly falls apart about the time of the Industrial Revolution, which really should be called the Invention Revolution. Suddenly, a small population of English and then Americans start inventing at a much higher rate in proportion to their population than anywhere else in the world.

What was the rate of invention before the Industrial Revolution? The evidence is that new inventions before the Industrial Revolution increased in relation to the population but did not result in increases in per capita wealth. David Ricardo’s skepticism about inventions improving people’s lives appears to have been correct historically. The agricultural revolution increased human population, but people were still stuck in the Malthusian trap.

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375756m_tmp_e7ea14855234e017.jpg)

This graph is modified from a chart in, _Farewell to Alms, A Brief Economic History of the World,_ by Gregory Clark Princeton University Press 2007, p. 2.

This chart shows the income per capita from 1000 BC to approximately 2000 AD and is most representative of the US, England, and the West. It also presents one of the most important questions in economics: Why did real per capita income start to grow around 1800? It also begs the questions of why the Industrial Revolution started in England and the US and not elsewhere.

Until the Industrial Revolution around 1800, people were stuck in the Malthusian trap, which means they lived on the edge of starvation. We know that the only way for real per capita income to increase is for the level of technology to increase. Great Britain and the US have no one to acquire this technology from, so they suddenly had to increase the rate at which they invented. It is not surprising that Great Britain and the US had the only, or at least most effective, property rights in inventions and these legal systems were created or perfected around 1800. These property rights allowed per capita income to start growing exponentially. Note, this occurred with an exponentially growing population. Economic growth is due to inventions, and the advent of property rights in inventions spurred people to invent more, which resulted in the Industrial Revolution.[42](#sdfootnote42sym)

At the advent of the Industrial Revolution, France had a larger economy and a scientific community that was at least equal to England’s. William Rosen, in his book _The Most Powerful Idea in the World_, shows that it was England’s patent system that encouraged many of the English scientists to work on practical inventions and not just theoretical science; while in France, the scientific community shunned anything to do with commerce. As Rosen explains:

France and Britain: the former a national culture with a powerful affection for pure over applied knowledge, the latter the first nation on earth to give inventors the legally sanctioned right to exploit their ideas.[43](#sdfootnote43sym)

Rosen explains, “the Industrial Revolution was, first and foremost, a revolution in invention.”[44](#sdfootnote44sym) He has an interesting way of illustrating the dominance of English-speaking people living in countries with property rights for inventions in driving the Industrial Revolution. He points to a steam locomotive in the Science Museum in London known as the Rocket that was built in the 1820s to transport goods from Manchester to Liverpool. The Rocket incorporates hundreds of inventions, and if you could magically edit out all the inventions created in Italy, Sweden, France, or China, the Rocket would still run. If you did the same thing with the inventions created in England, Scotland, Wales, and America, the display would be empty.[45](#sdfootnote45sym)

Of course, Venice had a patent system, so why did the Industrial Revolution not begin there? Part of the answer is that Venice was too small, and their patent system did not cover a large enough market. The value of an invention is partly determined by the size of the market and the smaller the market, the fewer inventions in which it makes sense to invest. It also means you have fewer people, which means fewer potential inventors. Venice was just not large enough to achieve critical mass. However, it is important to note that Venice was incredibly wealthy by the standards of the day with some of the greatest inventors ever, including Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo, whom both took advantage of the Venice patent system. This was also the time of the Italian Renaissance. Another part of the answer is that Venice’s patent system was not built on a sound property system that applied to everyone.

Switzerland did not have a patent system until 1888 but was relatively wealthy. Switzerland was a relatively small market, and because the Swiss could avail themselves of other countries’ patent systems, they could free ride somewhat. However, there is evidence that the types of technologies the Swiss developed shifted from technologies that could be kept a trade secret to a broader class of technologies after the passage of their patent law.[46](#sdfootnote46sym)

The Japanese people were still stuck in the Malthusian trap in the 1880s, when Japan sent a delegation to examine other countries’ patent systems.

In 1886 Takahashi Korekiyo was sent on a mission to examine patent systems in Europe and the United States. The Japanese envoy was not favorably impressed with the European countries in this regard. Instead, he reported: “… we have looked about us to see what nations are the greatest, so that we could be like them; … and we said, `What is it that makes the United States such a great nation?’ and we investigated and we found it was patents, and we will have patents.” The first national patent statute in Japan was passed in 1888, and copied many features of the U.S. system, including the examination procedures.[47](#sdfootnote47sym)

In 1888, Japan passed a patent law that closely resembled the US’s. As the chart below shows, this is about the time Japan escaped the Malthusian trap. Note, this is also the case for China.

Since Japan was behind the US and Europe technologically in the 1880s, they could have just imported technology rather than create new technology to start the climb out of the Malthusian trap. Acquiring existing technologies can be accomplished just by freeing up capital investment rules without a patent system. This is clearly the case with China also. However, they both adopted a patent system as they embraced private property rights. This is logical since patents are private property rights for invention.

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375756m_tmp_41c07843c95ec28e.png)

Having a patent system without having a system of private property does not make any sense. What would it mean to own your invention but not be able to own the physical embodiments of your invention? As a result, we would not expect any natural experiments on point. However, the Soviet Union, as was their tendency, tried the impossible; a patent system without property rights in general. What this meant in practice was a system of cash rewards to inventors. It was a disaster.[48](#sdfootnote48sym)

If Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong were on the above chart, they would start to escape the Malthusian trap about the time they adopted patent laws. Of course, as Paul Romer points out, all they needed to do to increase their per capita income dramatically was to adopt technology from the West. In fact, this is why less developed countries that are lower on the economic freedom scale are able to achieve higher growth rates than more advanced countries with higher economic freedom ratings. They can buy the latest technology and skip the steps in between. For instance, they do not need to start with an analog telephone system and switch operators. They can skip past early digital switches, analog cell phones, fiber optics with electronic repeaters, and go straight to a modern digital cellular phone system, with a modern optical amplified fiber optic backbone, thus, saving the cost and time that the creators of this system had to undergo.

The wealthiest, most inventive countries with the greatest dispersion of technology all have strong patent systems. If you look at the 2008 Index of Economic Freedom, the top five freest countries are Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland, Australia, and the United States. All of which have strong patent systems. The bottom five most repressive countries are Burma, Libya, Zimbabwe, Cuba, and North Korea, all of which have either the weakest or non-existent patent systems. All of these countries are still in the Malthusian trap, do not create new technologies, and have very little technology dispersion. If you group countries in quintiles of freedom, as the economic freedom index does, this trend would be true between each group. This lack of technology dispersion is inconsistent with Paul Romer’s idea that you want strong incentives to invent, but weak property rights for inventions for dissemination of new technologies. Since 2008, the USA has fallen significantly in economic freedom rankings and not surprisingly, its patent system has become significantly weaker.

A paper by the National University of Singapore shows a strong correlation between economic freedom and strong patent systems and economic growth.[49](#sdfootnote49sym) This correlation was strongest for the most economically advanced countries, but true across all countries.[50](#sdfootnote50sym) It is not surprising that less technologically advanced countries show a smaller correlation. These countries can grow based on importing technologies, and they can piggyback on the patent systems of the most advanced countries. However, if they fail to develop a culture of inventing, then they will eventually stagnate and always be one step behind the technological leaders.

The Bayh-Dole Act in the US presents an interesting natural experiment in patents and property rights. Before the act was passed in 1980, the US government owned 28,000 patents from publicly funded research. However, less than 5% of these were licensed, which roughly correlates with being commercialized.[51](#sdfootnote51sym) “The Bayh-Dole Act grew out of the Congress' efforts to respond to the economic malaise of the 1970s.”[52](#sdfootnote52sym) Before Bayh-Dole, “the government did not have a unified patent policy governing all the agencies that funded research, and the general policy was that government would retain title to inventions and would license them only nonexclusively.”[53](#sdfootnote53sym) Effectively, this meant that the inventions could not be owned, with the result that science research funded by the federal government, at the cost of billions of dollar, was just gathering dust.

The Bayh-Dole encouraged exclusive licensing[54](#sdfootnote54sym) of patents and technology developed with government funding. The results were that by 2008, there were about 35,000 patents licensed from publicly funded research.[55](#sdfootnote55sym) The _Economist_ stated:

Possibly the most inspired piece of legislation to be enacted in America over the past half-century was the Bayh-Dole act of 1980. Together with amendments in 1984 and augmentation in 1986, this unlocked all the inventions and discoveries that had been made in laboratories throughout the United States with the help of taxpayers' money. More than anything, this single policy measure helped to reverse America's precipitous slide into industrial irrelevance.[56](#sdfootnote56sym)

The Bayh-Dole Act shows that ownership of inventions is vital to their being disseminated, which completely contradicts Paul Romer’s thesis that patent rights inhibit the adoption of new technologies. The only potential caveat is that while it was the policy of federal agencies to license technology non-exclusively, even obtaining a non-exclusive license was often a bureaucratic nightmare.

The evidence from the Industrial Revolution and Bayh-Dole is that inventions are subject to a tragedy of the commons, not from overuse, but underinvestment. The evidence is overwhelming that inventions are exogenous. A number of economists have shown that inventors are motivated by financial return. For instance, Jacob Schmookler, in his book _Invention and Economic Growth_, shows that demand or expected return is the biggest factor affecting the number of inventions in a particular industry.[57](#sdfootnote57sym) His results were echoed by economic historian Zorina Khan.[58](#sdfootnote58sym) She provides extensive evidence that the US patent system and economic forces affect both the level and direction of invention. She shows that the US created the first modern patent system and the patent system provided the major incentive that caused the US to grow from an agrarian economy to a world economic and technology power in just 70 years.[59](#sdfootnote59sym) Note, there was very little government-sponsored research and development at the time.

The examples above show that patents, i.e., property rights for inventions, are a major incentive for inventors to invest more time and energy in creating inventions. It also shows that patents are effective at disseminating inventions. These examples also show that the creation and dissemination of inventions are critical to economic growth. In fact, there is no evidence that man would have escaped the Malthusian trap without property rights for inventions.

Despite this, many people argue that government funding for inventions is highly successful and better than a system of property rights for inventors. Academic economists often complain that patents lead to rent seeking and are monopolies, a subject we will discuss shortly. There are two fundamental flaws in their arguments. One is that patents are a property right and protection of property rights is not only necessary for economic growth, but also necessary for a just society. Second, the real rent seeking happens when governments attempt to fund R&D.

The advocates of this theory will point out that the American system of manufacturing was created, or at least advanced, when the government funded Eli Whitney to build ten thousand muskets, when the government funded the railroad network with the transcontinental railroad, when NASA created the electronics industry and jet aircraft. The forerunner of the Department of Energy created the nuclear power industry, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) created the Internet, and the Agriculture Department created ethanol fuels.

The transcontinental railroads were examples of the worst sort of crony capitalism, resulting in both railroads going bankrupt within ten years of the completion of the track. The track was poorly constructed.[60](#sdfootnote60sym) The government’s participation in energy technologies has been a disaster, from shale oil, to solar, to ethanol. Steven Mufson, in _Before Solyndra, a long history of failed government energy projects_ points out:

Not a single one of these much-ballyhooed initiatives is producing or saving a drop or a watt or a whiff of energy, but they have managed to burn through far more taxpayer money than the ill-fated Solyndra. An Energy Department report in 2008 estimated that the federal government had spent $172 billion since 1961 on basic research and the development of advanced energy technologies.[61](#sdfootnote61sym)

The electronics industry was built around computers, for accounting and other business tasks, and the consumer electronics industry. The Defense Departments and NASA merely piggybacked on these inventions. The groundbreaking inventions of integrated circuits, microcontrollers and microprocessors were created by private companies (Texas Instruments and Intel). Some of the early backbone behind the Internet might have been developed by the government, but the browser was a commercial invention. The Internet did not take off until the government got out of the way in the 1990s, and then the number of Internet-related inventions exploded and almost all of them were for and by the commercial sector.

Almost every major technological advance made in the US was due mainly to property rights provided by the patent system. These property rights made it possible to invest in creating and deploying these technologies. Without the patent system, these inventions would never have made it into the marketplace. Among these technologies are the telegraph, the telephone, the technology behind drilling for oil, the technology of cracking oil, the airplane, the copy machine, radio, television, the computer industry, the electronics industry, and yes, the Internet. The Patent Office is a totally self-funded agency, meaning it receives no federal tax dollars, which means the people of America and world have received this benefit without any cost to themselves. Direct government funding of R&D or cash prizes, as I called them, is fraught with rent seeking, waste and an abysmal failure.

If you look about your house and start to eliminate things that were subject to a patent, you will find that your house would not be standing today without those inventions. For instance, you are probably reading this on an electronic device. The plastic that makes the case was the subject of many patents, the steel was the subject of patents such as the Bessemer process, and the aluminum was the subject of many other patents. The electric device is made of transistors that were the subject of many patents, as were the integrated circuits, the microprocessor and the screen. You may be sitting in a chair using an electric light to read. The light bulb was the subject of numerous patents; the electrical generator that produces the power was the subject of numerous other patents, so they are all gone. The chair you are sitting in almost certainly has upholstery that was sewed together by machines and, therefore, the subject of hundreds of patents. Of course, if the fabric is a synthetic then it was the subject of patents, but even natural fibers were woven together using machines that were the subject of many patents. Even the glass in the windows you may be staring out of was the subject of many patents going all the way back to the Venice Patent Statute. The wood in your house was cut and planed with machines that were patented. The cement was the subject of other patents. Edison had a patent on a type of cement. In short, our modern world would not exist today without inventions that were the subject of patents.

# Chapter 7: Academic Arguments Against Patents

Despite the overwhelming evidence that patents drive the creation of inventions, which are the only way to increase real per capita income, a number of academic arguments have been advanced against patents. We cannot cover all the arguments, but most of them come in three varieties: 1) patents give monopoly power under the pure and perfect competition argument, 2) the tragedy of the anti-commons, and 3) patents are not legitimate property rights.

According to Wikipedia, “In economic theory, perfect competition (sometimes called pure competition) describes markets such that no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product.”[62](#sdfootnote62sym) The article goes on to define the characteristics of a perfectly competitive market as:

Generally, a perfectly competitive market exists when every participant is a "price taker,” and no participant influences the price of the product it buys or sells. Specific characteristics may include:

**A large number of buyers and sellers**—A large number of consumers with the willingness and ability to buy the product at a certain price, and a large number of producers with the willingness and ability to supply the product at a certain price.

**No barriers of entry and exit**—No entry and exit barriers makes it extremely easy to enter or exit a perfectly competitive market.

**Perfect factor mobility**—In the long run, factors of production are perfectly mobile, allowing free long-term adjustments to changing market conditions.

**Perfect information**—All consumers and producers are assumed to have perfect knowledge of price, utility, quality and production methods of products.

**Zero transaction costs**—Buyers and sellers do not incur costs in making an exchange of goods in a perfectly competitive market.

**Profit maximization**—Firms are assumed to sell where marginal costs meet marginal revenue, where the most profit is generated.

**Homogenous products—**The qualities and characteristics of a market good or service do not vary between different suppliers.

**Non-increasing returns to scale**—The lack of increasing returns to scale (or economies of scale) ensures that there will always be a sufficient number of firms in the industry.

**Property rights**—Well defined property rights determine what may be sold, as well as what rights are conferred on the buyer.

**Rational buyers**—buyers capable of making rational purchases based on information given

**No externalities**—costs or benefits of an activity do not affect third parties[63](#sdfootnote63sym)

Economists admit that almost no markets meet this definition; however, they argue, “perfect competition can be used as a yardstick to compare with other market structures because it displays high levels of economic efficiency.”[64](#sdfootnote64sym) Some economists have gone so far as to define capitalism as perfect competition. Under perfect competition, no producer can make an economic profit. They must sell their product at their marginal cost. Economists use this model to say any market that does not follow this is a monopolistic market or monopolistic competition, with monopolistic participants that are causing economic loss in the economy.

This book has shown that inventions are the only way to increase real per capita income, and patents are the key policy tool for unleashing inventors. How well does this fit with the perfect competition model? By definition, a new invention is unique and, therefore, does meet the perfect information or homogeneous product characteristics of perfect competition. Having a patent on the invention means the inventor has the right to exclude others from using their invention, so this does not meet the _no barriers to entry_ and may not meet the _large number of buyers and sellers_ characteristics. According to perfect competition, patents and inventions provide monopoly power and, therefore, are not economically efficient. The reality is that all property rights provide monopoly power under the theory of perfect competition, and some economists are honest enough to admit it. For instance, the grocer who owns the store on the corner of a busy intersection with good parking versus the grocer with a store on a dead end street with little traffic or the farmer who owns the most fertile land in the county versus the farmer who owns the least productive rocky land. In both of these cases, property rights will ensure that one person will have more power over the prices they can charge, which will give them more power over what they will pay for other goods. Perfect competition is completely incompatible with the conditions necessary for real per capita economic growth and is inconsistent with property rights, which Hernando de Soto and thousands of natural experiments have shown are key for maximizing the output of assets. It is confusing how economists can consider perfect competition economically efficient.

Let’s take a look at how this idea of “perfect competition” works out in our Robinson Crusoe economics. Now you might complain that “perfect competition” cannot be applied to a man on a deserted island since there are not numerous buyers and sellers, and there is no price. However, one of the key conclusions of “perfect competition” is that the price is equal to the marginal cost of production and there is a perfect analogy to this for our Robinson Crusoe. His marginal cost of production is the number of calories he expends in any activity, which must be equal to the number of calories consumed (or saved). In other words, Robinson is living on the edge of starvation, which in economic terms is the Malthusian trap. This means that if Robinson gets sick and cannot fish, hunt, or farm, then he will starve to death. Under perfect competition theory, Robinson will not be allowed to invent a net so his fishing will provide him with enough economic profit (surplus calories) to build a sturdy shelter, an irrigation ditch or a boat. What this shows is that economic profit is necessary for life. Every human requires so many calories a day, even resting. To stay alive, Robinson must produce more calories than this rest rate of burning calories, plus any additional calories he expends on his activities. The greater the number of excess calories he can produce, the more likely he will continue to live through sickness, drought, or natural catastrophe. Economic profit is necessary for life.

Perfect competition is supposed to be an ideal against which we measure other markets. However, it excludes the possibility of invention because they do not create a homogenous product. Some economists might argue this is not true. You can invent, but you must provide the information on how to make the invention to everyone simultaneously under the perfect information plank, which results in a homogenous product. This is Paul Romer’s position, and he preserves the ideal of perfect competition in his economic models. However, this book has shown that just creating inventions does not ensure their dissemination. There would be no reason for anyone to use the information to produce copies of the invention because they would not be allowed to make any economic profit, which means there is no reason to invest in an invention any more than any other investment. What is it called when a person cannot keep their inventions, and is not allowed to get a return on their efforts or a return on their knowledge? In other words, what is it called when a person does not own themselves and the product of their labor (mental and physical)?

Let’s examine how perfect competition would view the Industrial Revolution, the first time in history that large numbers of people escaped the Malthusian trap. The first person to invent a practical steam engine was Thomas Savery, in 1698 in England. Of course, inventions do not meet the _perfect information_ characteristic of perfect competition, so it fails the ideal. The first application for this steam engine was to pump water from mines. Savery patented his invention, which fails the no _barriers to entry or exit_ characteristic of perfect competition. Savery’s sales pitch to mine owners was that they would be able to remove water from their coal mines and, therefore, increase their return. This, of course, would fail the _no economic profit_ and the _homogenous product_ planks of perfect competition. However, it might be okay if Savery were to publish his work, under Paul Romer’s ideas. Nevertheless, the owners of the mine would need to invest money to install these devices, and they would not be allowed to earn an economic profit from this investment. Under perfect competition, Savery’s steam engine would never have been made or if made it would never have been deployed. If Savery’s device were never made, then the coal mines would have played out fairly quickly and more importantly, Thomas Newcomen would have never invented the first piston steam engine that would lead to the cheap power that drove the Industrial Revolution. In short, under perfect competition, the Industrial Revolution or Invention Revolution would never have happened, and we would still be living in the Malthusian trap.

Proponents of perfect completion say it results in allocative efficient markets. I am confused about what they mean by this. If we use perfect competition as our standard, we will drive humankind back into the Malthusian trap. This is like saying that India’s economy is more economically efficient than Singapore’s is because in India very few people are producing an economic profit compared to Singapore and very few people in India have any market power, while in Singapore, a large part of the population has market power. The measure of economic efficiency for Robinson Crusoe is the number of excess calories he is able to produce compared to the number of calories expended. In a macroeconomic sense, this means economic efficiency is the wealth created above the amount necessary for people in a country to subsist. In India, many people are living at or near the Malthusian trap, which is a very inefficient economy. While in Singapore, most people are making at least ten times the subsistence income level. Real economic efficiency would be the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) divided by the subsistence level in monetary terms.

Under perfect competition, people are not allowed to use their mind or at least to profit from their mind by inventing. It does not allow people to profit by making wise investment decisions or choosing a more profitable profession. Property rights are not allowed, and natural differences between people are not allowed. Think of the automatons in a gulag, such as Mao’s reeducation camps. Every person is treated exactly the same, and all are required to put out homogenous products. The perfect competition ideal is people living on the edge of starvation who are slaves. It is not a scientific theory; it is a moral theory, one that promotes slavery and death.

Under perfect competition, every property right, even property rights in yourself, are monopolies or provide monopoly power. This stretches the definition of monopoly to the point of nonsense and is inconsistent with the historical definition of monopoly. Now that we have dispensed with the perfect competition model as being a useful tool for determining what is a monopoly and what is a property right, we can examine whether patents are a monopoly on a rational basis.

According to Wikipedia, “In economics, a government-granted monopoly (also called a ‘de jure monopoly’) is a form of coercive monopoly by which a government grants exclusive privilege to a private individual or firm to be the sole provider of a good or service; potential competitors are excluded from the market by law, regulation, or other mechanisms of government enforcement.” Since patents are clearly “government granted,” then this is the appropriate definition. A patent gives the holder the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention (The US Patent Act, 35 USC 154). It does not give the holder the right to make, use, or sell their invention, so a patent holder has not been given a government grant to be “the sole provider of a good or service.”

There is a lot of nonsense in the economic profession about monopolies as shown above with respect to perfect competition. Even the definition above can lead to nonsense. For instance, according to Locke’s natural rights theory, you own yourself, so you own the product of your labor, both mental and physical. This means anything you produce you have the exclusive right to make and sell. Does this make you a monopolist?

The historical basis for monopolies is the Statute of Monopolies of 1623 in England. The Statute of Monopolies prohibited the Crown from issuing monopolies for items that were already known or being produced. The idea was to protect the natural rights of Englishmen to practice their craft. In today’s language, in issuing a monopoly, the government was interfering with private citizens’ rights to their property. However, the statute did not prevent an exclusive grant for inventions. The reason for this in the words of the day was an invention did not interfere with, or take away, anything from private citizens. The invention did not exist before it was invented, so it does not take away anything from private citizens to provide a limited term property right to the inventor. In other words, a monopoly is an edict by the government that infringes the property rights of others. The Statute of Monopolies was designed to be a limitation on the power of government.

Modern antitrust law has turned the concept of monopolies on its head. Instead of being a limitation on government power, like the Statute of Monopolies, it is a limitation on private action. Instead of protecting people’s rights to their property, like the Statute of Monopolies, it limits or takes away private property. The only logically consistent definition of a monopoly is an exclusive right to a market. No property right gives you an exclusive right to a market; it gives you the exclusive right to your property. Market success is not an exclusive right to a market. Only the government can create a monopoly.

American historian George H. Knight explained it this way:

How can the exclusive right of an invention be compared with a monopoly in trade? How can the exclusive privilege to sell salt in Elizabeth’s time, which added not one bushel to the production, but which enriched the monopolist and robbed the community, and the exclusive right of Whitney to his cotton gin, which has added hundreds of millions to the products and exports of the country, be both branded, with equal justice, with the odious name of monopoly?”[65](#sdfootnote65sym)

We have shown that using perfect competition to define a monopoly makes no sense. We have seen that, by the definition of a government granted monopoly, patents are not monopolies and modern anti-trust law has turned the rules against monopolies upside down. If patents were monopolies, then we should expect certain outcomes in markets that have patents. Specifically, patents should negatively affect the rate of creating new inventions and slow down the diffusion of inventions. If this thesis is correct, it should be testable. Let’s test this hypothesis. Below are the results that should occur if patents are a monopoly and what should occur if patents are a property right.

If MONOPOLY

1) Countries with strong patent systems should invent less than countries with weak patent systems.

2) Countries with strong patent systems should have slower dissemination of new technologies than those countries with weak patent systems.

If PROPERTY RIGHTS

1) Countries with the strongest patent systems should invent more than countries with weak patent systems.

2) Countries with strong patent systems should have faster dissemination of new technologies than those countries with weak patent systems.

Let’s examine the facts; according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the top ten most innovative countries and the bottom 10 countries for 2012 are:[66](#sdfootnote66sym)

Top 10 Bottom 10

1. Switzerland 132. Syrian Arab Republic

2. Sweden 133. Pakistan

3. Singapore 134. Cote d’Ivoire

4. Finland 135. Angola

5. United Kingdom 136. Togo

6. Netherlands 137. Burundi

7. Denmark 138. Lao PDR

8. Hong Kong (China) 139. Yemen

9. Ireland 140. Niger

10. United States of America 141. Sudan

In a report from the National University of Singapore, they also have a couple of charts for the countries with the strongest patent systems for four different years and those with the weakest patent systems.[67](#sdfootnote67sym) I do not know if all countries were included in this survey.

Top countries

|Guyana 1.78|Guatemala 1.50|Guatemala 2.15|Rwanda 4.64|
|Jordan 1.72|Peru 1.31|Peru 1.73|Zaire 3.51|

If we examine the first postulate, does it appear the most inventive countries have the strongest patent systems or the weakest patent systems? Which countries have the strongest patent systems—the USA, Singapore, Switzerland or Niger, Pakistan, or Sudan? It is clear that the most inventive countries according to the WIPO survey also have the strongest patent systems. If we look at the charts from the National University of Singapore (NUS), we see those countries with the strongest patent systems are clearly the most inventive. Although the WIPO data and the NUS data are from different time frames, we see some overlap between those countries with the strongest patent systems (NUS) and the most inventive (WIPO) countries and the same is true for the countries with the weakest patent systems and least inventive countries.

Examining the second postulate, it is clear that those countries with the strongest patents have the most technology diffusion.

The macroeconomic evidence does not support the thesis that patents are a monopoly. The data shows the exact opposite of what this theory predicts. However it is consistent with the idea that patents are property rights.

# Chapter 8: Are Patents Property Rights?

Most economists take property rights as a given and do not examine their basis. There are three broad theories of property rights: 1) property rights are a fiction and do not exist (generally, these are Marxist), 2) utilitarian, and 3) natural rights. The utilitarian view of property rights is that they are socially useful tools for distributing scarce resources. The natural rights view of property rights is that people own themselves, so they own those things they create. Most economists seem to follow the utilitarian model of property rights, including Paul Romer.

We can dispense with the first theory that property rights do not or should not exist, as we have already shown that property rights are key to economic growth. Followers of the utilitarian model of property rights argue that ideas (inventions) are not subject to scarcity and, therefore, are not the proper subject of property rights. Tangible property rights include real property rights in land and buildings and personal property rights in things like cars and furniture. Tangible or physical property is scarce since it can only be owned by one person at a time, and it takes resources to create. Intangible or intellectual property such as patents and copyrights, and software, according to some, is not scarce according to this theory. Intangible property can be owned by multiple people without excluding others from the same property. According to Tom G. Palmer, a proponent of the scarcity theory of property:

It is this scarcity that gives rise to property rights. Intellectual property rights, however, do not rest on a natural scarcity of goods, but on an “artificial, self-created scarcity.”[68](#sdfootnote68sym)

How is property and how are property rights allocated under the utilitarian model? The logical answer appears to be in the way that provides the most social utility or eliminates the most scarcity. Are property rights, once allocated, fixed under the utilitarian model, or if better social utility can be achieved by reallocating property rights, is that allowed? Who gets to decide? This is not an academic question, as the US Supreme Court _Kelo v. City of New London_ shows. The town council of New London thought that they would receive more tax revenue if they could transfer the ownership of some land from homeowners to a large corporation. Their argument was that property rights are limited by social utility (i.e., tax revenue in this case) and they won. This brings up the question of whether you own yourself under the utilitarian model. What if better social utility could be had if you did not own yourself?

The natural rights basis for property rights starts with the axiom that you own yourself. If you do not own yourself, which includes the product of your efforts, you are a slave.[69](#sdfootnote69sym) If you own yourself, then you own your creations (physical and mental). Under the natural rights approach, it is clear why you own property.

Since you own yourself, you have the right to contract (i.e., enter into a legally binding agreement), which is how most people acquire property today. They trade their labor for currency. Then, they use the currency to buy food, cars, houses, etc. However, they still own those things they create; they just traded the product of their labor, under a contract, immediately to their employer in exchange for money.

The natural rights approach explains why slavery is illegal. If you own yourself, then no one else has the right to own you. It also explains why murder and manslaughter are illegal, why stealing is illegal, and why assault and battery are illegal; in fact, it explains most of our common law criminal law. Natural rights defines how property should be allocated and how people come into possession of property legally and morally. It explains all of our basic criminal law and all of our basic property laws. What does the utilitarian model of property rights explain? It offers no justification for why slavery, murder, manslaughter, assault, battery, and theft are immoral, except that they are inefficient at allocating resources. Thus, all of these crimes would be allowed if they were efficient at allocating resources. Scarcity does not explain who has ownership in property or why they should have ownership in property. It merely explains that private property ownership is an efficient manner of allocating scarce resources.

In science, the theory that has the greatest ability to explain the widest number of facts is considered the correct or better theory. Here, the utilitarian theory of property rights requires the additional assumption that it is preferable to have an efficient allocation of resources. However, it fails to explain how the resource should be initially distributed; it does not explain how property law determines ownership and has no power to explain criminal law. Trading the utilitarian concept of property for natural rights is like trading the theory that “what goes up must come down” for Newton’s law of gravity. The fact of the matter is that the proponents of scarcity have confused cause with effect. A system of private property results in efficient allocation of resources, but it is not the reason for private property—it is the effect of private property.

Other detractors state that it is absurd to think that patents are natural rights. Yet, the idea that patents are natural rights was stated explicitly by Sir William Blackstone as early as 1769. Locke’s ideas were incorporated into the law of the United States by William Blackstone’s _Commentaries on the Laws of England_. This treatise became the basis of common law in the US, and Blackstone is clear that inventors’ natural rights in property are founded on the same basis as all property rights.[70](#sdfootnote70sym) The idea that patents are a natural right is incorporated into early American law as this quote shows, “We protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests as much a man’s own, and as much the fruit of his honest industry, as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears” (Davoll v. Brown, 7 F. Cas. 197, 199 [C.C.D. Mass. 1845]). Natural law provides the clearly superior basis for property rights, and patents are a property right under natural rights.

Another academic attack on patents is based on the paper, _The Tragedy of the Anticommons._[71](#sdfootnote71sym) The title of this paper is a play on the classic economics problem where no one owns a resource so that it becomes overused, such as public grazing land. If a rancher uses grazing lands that he does not own, what is his incentive to use the land sparingly? If the rancher does not use the land extensively, another rancher may. The anticommons thesis is that if too many people share an ownership right in a resource, they will block each other from developing the resource. The paper applies the concept to many aspects of the economy. When it is applied to patents, it is generally referred to as a _patent thicket_. The argument being that too many patent holders will block each other’s ability to develop an area of technology. Anticommons proponents suggest that a patent thicket exists with respect to the software and biomedical industries. If a patent thicket existed in the biotech industry, we would expect a decrease in economic activity in the biotech industry as companies are locked out of the market. However, a study of the number of start-ups, venture capital funding, and number of product introductions in the biotech industry shows the exact opposite situation.[72](#sdfootnote72sym) If a study were done about the software industry in the 1980s and 1990s, when patent rights were being acknowledged in software, it would clearly show a major increase in economic activity in the software industry as evidenced by the number of start-ups, amount of venture capital invested, product introductions, and employment. There is also no macroeconomic evidence for this theory as has already been shown in this book. The empirical evidence does not support the patent thicket argument. Historical evidence of patents clogging up development is also lacking.

Several papers[73](#sdfootnote73sym) have pointed out that the anticommons argument for patents is based on flawed analogies. One common analogy for the anticommons problem is a river in which multiple entities charge a toll to pass. No one entity has an incentive to maximize the revenue from the total tolls collected, so they each attempt to maximize their toll price, which causes underutilization of the river. This example assumes a single starting point and a single ending point. However, the “geography” of the technology world is more complex because there are multiple ways to get from point A to point B. In fact, railroads, highways, and airplanes all represent ways around the toll problem on the river. As long as government does not put artificial limitations on these competing technologies, they will develop solutions that also encompass many more starting and ending points, which are more convenient for the customer and producer. Note that one of the goals of patent law is to develop these alternative solutions by encouraging designing around of patents.[74](#sdfootnote74sym) The _Tragedy of the Anticommons_ as applied to patents has no empirical support and is based on analogies that are logically flawed.

Perfect competition is a failed theory and should rightly be called Orwellian competition. Monopoly, properly defined, is government interference with property rights that gives an exclusive privilege to a market. Property rights cannot be monopolies. The best theory of property rights is natural rights. Patents are clearly property rights under this formulation.

  
  

# Chapter 9: The Study of Inventions, Inventors and the Inventing Process

Considering how important inventions are to economic growth, it is surprising how little they have been studied. One of the first people to study inventing systematically was the economic historian, Abbott Payson Usher, who cataloged his ideas in _The History of Mechanic Inventions,_ which was originally published in 1929.[75](#sdfootnote75sym) This book traces the history of inventions related to clocks, watches, printing, power, machine tools, and others. Based on this effort, Usher suggested that the creation of every invention follows a four-step process.

1. awareness of an unfulfilled need;

2. recognition of something contradictory or absent in existing attempts to meet the need, which Usher called an “incomplete pattern”;

3. an all-at-once insight about the pattern; and

4. a process of “critical revision” during which the insight is tested, refined and perfected.[76](#sdfootnote76sym)

I am not sure that the creation of every invention follows this process, but most do. For instance, I do not know what the unfulfilled need for the laser was. Generally, there may have been a small need for a coherent, monochromatic light source. However, the motivation for the laser seemed to be a desire to show that it was possible.

I also do not believe that every invention includes an “all-at-once” insight. It appears dangerously like the discredited “flash of genius” standard the Supreme Court announced in the _Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp_. 314 U.S. 84 (1941). The 1952 Patent Act explicitly rejected the “flash of genius” standard.[77](#sdfootnote77sym) Plenty of inventions are created by slow, deliberate work. Some inventions are created once the need is understood.

The process of inventing often is as much about knowing the history of technology in that area or a related area as about science and analytics. This is something that engineering schools should keep in mind. When the author was in engineering school, they focused almost exclusively on analysis. There has been some effort to correct this and the advent of inexpensive computers has helped engineering schools beef up their design classes. However, they still could add more courses on the history of technology as part of their curriculum. The best source for understanding the history of any modern technology is patents. All engineering and technology students should learn how to search patents and how to read them. Ideally, they should learn a little about patent law and the process of obtaining a patent.

The economist Jacob Schmookler undertook an econometric study of inventions in his classic book _Invention and Economic Growth.[78](#sdfootnote78sym)_ The opening line is “What laws govern the growth of man’s mastery over nature?”[79](#sdfootnote79sym) He examines a number of important questions in this area, including whether the creation of inventions is driven by the market or by scientific discovery. Is there a limit to the number of inventions that can be created? How many patents are commercialized? Are inventions inevitable?

One of the points Schmookler makes is that “society generally uses far more of its resources to disseminate technology than to advance it.”[80](#sdfootnote80sym) This is particularly relevant to the scarcity question about inventions. If dissemination is not free, as Paul Romer and others suggest, then property rights for inventions are critical for dissemination.

Schmookler’s book echoes many of the themes in this book. He states, “unfortunately, neoclassical as well as classical economics seems better adapted to the analysis of replication than to that of technological change.”[81](#sdfootnote81sym) By replication, Schmookler means an economy based on manufacturing (reproduction) that is technologically stagnant. The problem with this is “the vast economic changes since the Stone Age, or for that matter during recent centuries in the West, were possible only because of technological progress.”[82](#sdfootnote82sym) In other words, economics has failed to study the most important questions in economics.

Schmookler provides a slightly different definition of invention than this book:

Every invention is (a) a new combination of (b) pre-existing knowledge, which (c) satisfies some want.[83](#sdfootnote83sym)

This definition makes it clear that inventions are a combination of pre-existing knowledge and elements. Many people and judges (include those on the US Supreme Court) have tried to define an invention as something completely new. This we know to be impossible because inventions would then need to violate conservation of matter and energy. One problem with the above definition is that it does not differentiate art from invention. Paintings, songs, books, etc. are combinations of pre-existing knowledge that satisfies some want.

Schmookler makes an interesting analogy between inventions, genetics, and evolution. He explains inventions created today are based on knowledge and inventions produced earlier, which provides a genetic basis to invention. However, there is a huge selection process in which inventions go forward. “In the case of invention the selecting factor is man himself.”[84](#sdfootnote84sym) Because of this, inventing is “an economic choice made in the context of economic change.”[85](#sdfootnote85sym)

Most economists, according to Schmookler, assume that inventions are driven by scientific discoveries and, as a result, are noneconomic.[86](#sdfootnote86sym) He shows that inventors and inventions are influenced by economic interests much more than scientific discoveries. It should also be pointed out that the creation of many inventions preceded the underlying science. For instance, the steam engine preceded the science of thermodynamics and was a major impetus for its study.

The most important finding in the book according to Schmookler is the amount of inventive activity in an industry is directly related to the size of the market.[87](#sdfootnote87sym) This means that the process of inventing is largely an economic activity pursued for gain, and the expected gain is mainly determined by the size of the market to which the invention is directed.[88](#sdfootnote88sym)

B. Zorina Khan is an economic historian who has studied patents extensively. She has done yeoman’s work in cataloging the patent systems of US and Europe in the 19th century. However, there is more work to be done in this area. She is the author of the book, _The Democratization of Invention: Patents and Copyrights in American Economic Development, 1790-1920_.[89](#sdfootnote89sym) One of the points that Khan makes in this book is that the US in the 19th century was more concerned with protecting inventions and somewhat suspicious of protecting art. Europe in the 19th century was the exact opposite. Today it appears the US has followed the lead of Europe.

Ms. Kahn’s book provides extensive evidence that the US patent system and economic forces affect both the level and direction of invention. She explains that the U.S. created the first modern intellectual property system. This system is credited as a major factor in the U.S. becoming a technological leader in the world in less than 75 years. The U.S. patent system was so successful that it was widely copied by many European nations and Japan in the 19th century.

William Brian Arthur is another economist who has studied inventions, and he has an electrical engineering background. His book, _The Nature of Technology: What It Is and How It Evolves,[90](#sdfootnote90sym)_ points out that technology defines our standard of living. Increasing one’s level of technology is the only way to increase real per capita income. The book starts by defining a technology (invention) as a unique combination of elements and the author repeatedly points out that every technology is built on existing elements (technologies) and scientific phenomena. The problem with this definition is that it does not explain the difference between technology and art.

Arthur differentiates between standard engineering and invention. “Standard engineering, as I have defined it, deals with known technologies. This makes each design a new version—a new instance—of something already known.”[91](#sdfootnote91sym) He explains, “a change in principle then separates out invention—the process by which radically novel technologies arise—from standard engineering.”[92](#sdfootnote92sym) The problem with this definition is that it is not objective. What is a change in principle? All steam engines use the principle that a temperature difference can be used to do mechanical work. Does this mean that Newcomen’s steam engine is not an invention in light of Thomas Savery’s steam pump? Newcomen used a piston and, therefore, was able to pump water from deeper levels in coal mines, which was the first use of steam engines. Does this mean that James Watts’s steam engine that used a separate condenser and was more powerful than Newcomen’s is not an invention? How about the inventors who created high-pressure steam engines?

Arthur explains that a new system of technology (jet engines instead of prop engines) requires new component technologies. He has several interesting historical examples of this. The book shows that both technology and biological entities are built hierarchically, and higher levels of technology cannot be created until the building blocks are in place. The author explains that neither technology nor the economy is ever in equilibrium.[93](#sdfootnote93sym)

Arthur states, “I will define the economy as the set of arrangements and activities by which a society satisfies its needs (This makes economics the study of this.)”[94](#sdfootnote94sym) This is close to my definition. However, society does not have needs; people do. And society should be changed to people. This makes it clear that Robinson Crusoe economics applies.

Arthur lays out what he calls three fundamental principles. The first is “technologies are combinations.”[95](#sdfootnote95sym) The second is “each component of technology is itself in miniature a technology.”[96](#sdfootnote96sym) The third is “all technologies harness and exploit some effect or phenomenon, usually several.”[97](#sdfootnote97sym)

  
  

# Chapter 10: Natural Laws of Invention

Natural laws organize an area of knowledge and allow one to think conceptually about problems. Following and categorizing logical results have led to some of the greatest discoveries in science. I have found that inventions are bound by certain natural laws and some of these have been discussed above.

(1) Conservation Law of Invention:

_All inventions are combinations of existing/known elements._

This point has been made by Schmookler, Arthur and many others. Conservation of matter (and energy) means that you cannot create something from nothing. As a result, all inventions must be a combination of existing or known elements. By element, I do not mean chemical elements but that the parts that make up an invention at some level must have existed before. For instance, the first laser was a ruby rod laser, and its three major components were a ruby rod, a flash lamp, and a Fabry-Perot resonator (two parallel mirrors). All three of these things existed when the laser was invented. For those people who want to point to Americium (94), Curium (96), and Berkelium (97), all of these chemical elements are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons and all of these were existing elements.

Mr. Arthur is correct “all technologies harness and exploit some effect or phenomenon, usually several.” Inventions are not magic.

(2) Causality Law of Invention:

_Invention precedes production. Production precedes consumption._

This statement is true for every invention. In order to consume (use) an invention it first has to be invented and then produced. Very few of the things we consume or use are not inventions. Some of the exceptions include mother’s milk and air. This law explains why inventions define our standard of living and not production or consumption.

(3) Set Law of Invention:

_The number of potential inventions is infinite._

Every invention is a combination, and every invention can act as an element (component) for another invention. This means that the number of potential inventions grows combinatorially (N!). Of course, potential inventions are not actual inventions and not every combination will result in something useful. This does not absolutely prove that the number of inventions is infinite. However, for the number of potential inventions to be limited, there would need to be some reason why new inventions suddenly were not combinable with older inventions. In fact, the world has shown more interconnectedness between new technologies. For instance, electronics and the world of combustion engines used to be quite distinct, but now electronics have replaced mechanical carburetors and are now intimately intertwined in combustion engines.

Some people have suggested that the number of inventions is limited by the total mass and energy of the universe. First of all, the latest thinking in cosmology does not necessarily recognize a finite universe or finite mass and energy. Second, this would limit the implementation of all the inventions at once, but not necessarily the number of potential inventions.

This does not mean that inventions are inevitable. There have been cases where people have lost technologies, including medieval Europe’s loss of the knowledge of the invention of cement.

(4) Rate Law of Invention:

_The rate of invention is dependent on the number of inventors, the size of the set of elements (i.e., components, earlier inventions) the inventors can access, and the size of the set of goals._

Inventions are combinations of elements and connections, but an individual has to put together these combinations. If more individuals are involved in the process of trying out combinations, then there is a greater likelihood they will find a useful combination or invention. In a rough analogy, the more samples or children in a genetic algorithm, assuming they are diverse, the more likely or sooner you will find an acceptable solution. Individuals create these sample combinations and test them against selection criteria. If more people are creating these samples, then you increase your probability of inventing a useful product of service. The corollary is that you have more “failures” than you have successes.

A successful solution to a particular selection criteria or fitness criteria has an increased probability if the creators (inventors) have access to the complete set of elements available in the world. When the inventors are limited in their selection or application of existing elements, then it reduces the potential number of combinations. It is possible, in this case, that many solutions meeting the fitness criteria will not be part of the search space. This decreases the probability of finding a solution. When inventors’ freedom of action is restricted, it will decrease their chance of creating something useful.

Inventors as a group will be more successful if each individual inventor is allowed the freedom to pursue their own invention goal. There are at least two problems with restricting the goals of inventions. One, the individual’s talents and interests may fall into a forbidden area. Two, unexpected results may fall into a forbidden area and, therefore, not be pursued.

As a result, we see that freedom fosters invention. This is consistent with both our academic institutions’ policies and with capitalism (i.e., the economic system that is created when natural rights are protected by governments). Invention is not encouraged by plagiarism. Plagiarism results in wasted resources. This is one of the reasons for a patent system. We do not want people to plagiarize, but inventing around a patent, which creates a diversity of inventions, is good. The inventor is the first person to create a new technology because they add to the store of human knowledge. Even innocent copycats do not add to the store of human knowledge.

A corollary is that invention is fostered by wide dissemination of the information on how to build earlier inventions. Without this dissemination, individuals will waste time recreating technologies. This is why patent systems require a description of how to practice the invention.

However, this does not mean that just throwing people at the problem will work. In other words, the example of a 1000 monkeys typing on typewriters eventually will produce Romeo and Juliet. This combinatorial argument is false. It presumes the answer. Without the answer, there is no way to determine if you have created Romeo and Juliet. The same applies to software programs. Paul Romer has shown that the number of combinations for just a CD is virtually unlimited. The time to create a useful software program with random combinations is virtually infinite.

Reason and knowledge of science and technology are also keys to the success of inventors. Not all inventors are equal.

(5) Commons Law of Invention:

_Inventions are not subject to overuse. The creation of inventions is subject to underinvestment without property rights in inventions. The diffusion of inventions is subject to underinvestment without property rights in inventions._

Although there are an unlimited number of potential inventions, this does not mean that creating them is free. The U.S. spends over $300 billion per year on research and development to discover inventions.[98](#sdfootnote98sym) Just like real property, conceiving inventions takes scarce resources. The number of researchers, research facilities, and research equipment are all limited. Each researcher’s ability to pursue various inventions and discoveries is limited. It always costs less for a copier to produce existing items than to create their own inventions. This copying of inventions results in underinvestment in the creation of inventions.

Once an invention or discovery is made, it still costs considerable resources to distribute the invention. For instance, scientific principles are not subject to intellectual property rights and, therefore, can be freely disseminated. Despite this most people who learn science pay professors and others to teach them this freely availabl information. The U.S. spends over $500 billion per year on all forms of education. Adopting and distribution ideas, including inventions, is not free.

According to venture capitalists, most start-ups will spend 2-10 times the amount on marketing their inventions than on developing them. If the distribution of ideas were free, not subject to scarcity, this would clearly be unnecessary.

University professors, doctors, lawyers, engineers, judges, marketers, sales people, and computer scientists are mainly in the business of distributing or implementing known information. Most of these professionals would be unnecessary if distributing information was frictionless. Distributing information is extremely costly, especially new information.

Without property rights in inventions, most people and institutions will not spend the additional money required to create and distribute inventions. This results in underinvestment in creating inventions, which results in slower economic growth.

(6) Income Law of Inventions:

_The per capita income of a large group of people can only increase over the long term if their level of technology increases._

Real per capita increases in income can only result from new technologies. Adding capital (money or existing equipment) without any inventions associated with the capital will result in elevating every worker to a certain efficiency level, however, never above that level. Once every worker has all the capital resources that they can use in their job, they have hit a maximum output.

  
  

# Chapter 11: Accounting Rules Undercount Impact of Inventions

Accounting does not show any returns from inventions, but it does show the cost of creating those inventions. Research and development costs are immediately expensed. However, no asset is shown as being created as a result of these expenses. The assets that result from research and development are inventions protected by patents, trade secrets, and copyrights. Note, for something to be an asset, it must be owned by the entity. When a company makes a product that incorporates an invention, the accounting rules allocate all the profit to the manufacturing process and do not show any return on the invention. The one exception is for inventions that are licensed. In that case, the creator will show a return on the invention, and the licensee will show an expense. As a result, present accounting rules show inventing as an expense with no return. What hardheaded businessperson would invest in something that never showed a return?

As Nathan Myhrvold puts it, inventing is funded under a charity model.[99](#sdfootnote99sym) Governments and CEOs spend money in the hope that it will provide a return, but since they have no standard accounting mechanism for determining a return on this investment, it is just charity. This also causes companies to overvalue their manufacturing processes. Companies have no idea what their real return is on their manufacturing processes since they treat inventions as if they were free. As a result, these companies cannot make an intelligent decision concerning whether to manufacture a product using their inventions or whether they should license their technology to another entity.

For example, take a new cellular telephone that is the result of millions of dollars of investment in numerous inventions. Our accounting systems only allocate a return for the manufacturing of the phone and nothing for the inventions that made the phone possible. In the case of a new cellular telephone, most of the profit is due to the inventions, not to manufacturing. The retail value of the manufacturing of a cellular telephone is around the price of old technology cellular telephones, or presently $30 to $80, while new technology cellular phones cost $500 to $1000. The inventions are the reason for this difference in price.

These accounting errors contribute to the “not-invented-here” (NIH) problem. Since internally funded inventions appear to be free, externally purchased or licensed inventions look expensive in comparison. This causes reluctance on the part of many companies to license other entities’ technologies. This causes an underinvestment in inventions. Another problem that results from our flawed accounting systems is that brilliant engineers and scientists (inventors) are forced into management in order to obtain pay raises. Since our accounting systems show no value being derived from brilliant inventors, they are significantly underpaid. It is not surprising that many CEOs view the whole invention and patent process as just a tax necessary to enter a market without providing any real value. Is it any wonder that economists and business leaders do not understand the value of inventions and patents when our accounting system shows them as a cost without any return?

How do we fix our accounting systems, so they accurately reflect the value of investments in inventions? I am not an accountant; however, the basis of any solution should be to require a licensing fee from the manufacturing operation to the R&D operation for inventions incorporated into products. A sanity check on these valuations can be obtained by comparing the discounted cash flow value of these licenses to the company’s intangible assets value, as determined by the market value of the company. Most companies today have around 75% of their market value in intangible assets. These assets do not show up on a company’s balance sheet. That we accept a system not accounting for over half of companies’ value is gross negligence.

Modifying our accounting systems to track the value of inventions would show the value of these assets, result in them not being wasted, and increase investment in R&D. This would also provide a rational basis for a company to decide whether to use their inventions to manufacture a product, license the inventions to another entity, or purchase another entity’s technology. This would help eliminate the not-invented-here syndrome. It would also encourage active trading of inventions and additional investment in creating inventions. CEOs would then understand that investing in inventing is not charity, but key to their business success. Most importantly, we would all be wealthier since it would reduce underinvestment in inventions.[100](#sdfootnote100sym)

  
  

# Chapter 12: Entropy, Evolution, Economics

This book defines economics as the study of how people obtain those things they need to live. For example, Robinson Crusoe will burn 2000 calories per day doing nothing. This resting rate of burning calories we can consider to be entropy. Entropy was originally a concept from thermodynamics. One dictionary definition of entropy is that it is a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work. Here we are just using entropy to denote that every living being consumes energy that is not available for the organism to do useful work. We could just say that life requires energy without probably any loss of meaning. Failure to overcome this entropy results in the death of that organism. This means that life requires a profit in the sense that every organism has to acquire (produce) useful energy to overcome this entropy level. Robinson has to undertake activities that provide 2000 calories plus the calories necessary to undertake that activity just to break even. So we see life is a fight against entropy.

On a species level, life attempts to overcome entropy by adaptations that make it more successful at acquiring useful energy. The more successful the species is at acquiring useful energy, the greater its population will become, which will increase its chances of having offspring and useful adaptations. However, it will mean that the individuals in the species will also eventually begin to compete with each other for the resources that provide the energy to overcome the entropy. Because of population increases and using up the available energy, the species will be back at the point at which the calories it acquires are just on the edge of starvation, otherwise known as the Malthusian trap. Then, another adaptation of that species or another species will result in excess free energy, an increase in the population of that adapted species, and the process will repeat. There have been a number of proposals linking life, evolution, and entropy with varying success. An excellent paper describing these proposals is _Thermoeconomics: Beyond the Second Law, Journal of Bioeconomics_, by Peter Corning.[101](#sdfootnote101sym) The connection proposed by this book is fairly modest.

Humans, unlike other animals, alter their environment to obtain useful energy rather than waiting for genetic changes to make their physiology better adapted to the environment. The way humans do this is by creating things, i.e., inventing. One of the greatest inventions, actually thousands of inventions, was agriculture. This caused the human population to expand enormously, just as we would expect from evolution.

Agriculture seems to have arisen in the fertile crescent in the Middle East roughly 10,000 years ago. It started spreading about 9,000 years ago, taking about 4,000 years to spread to the northern and western fringes of Europe–Scandinavia, England and Spain–thus moving at about 1 kilometer a year. This transition was associated with a sharp rise in population.[102](#sdfootnote102sym)

Unfortunately, this invention or series of inventions (adaptations) did not result in an escape from the Malthusian trap as we have seen. This is exactly what David Ricardo predicted. New inventions would provide a lift to the standard of living for a while until the population increased and drove people back into the Malthusian trap. However, it does demonstrate the connections between economics and evolution. Inventions are the equivalent of adaptions from a survival point of view. In fact, the study of economics would be the same as the study of the evolution of humans, if humans were not rational animals that invent. Ray Kurzweil makes a similar point.

According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of evolution, more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (intentionally to design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency.[103](#sdfootnote103sym)

Despite this, it was not until the Industrial Revolution that humans began to invent (adapt) fast enough to overcome population growth and diminishing returns.

I am going to make conjecture that the law of diminishing returns is related to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in any isolated system entropy (energy not available to do useful work) never decreases. This is the reason it is impossible to build a perpetual motion machine. Of course, the Earth is not an isolated system. For instance, it receives tremendous amounts of energy from the Sun that can be used to reduce the entropy on Earth. Diminishing returns is the decrease in the marginal (incremental) output of a production process as the amount of a single factor of production is incrementally increased, while the amounts of all other factors of production stay constant.[104](#sdfootnote104sym) The common example is that if a farmer starts using fertilizer he will increase his output. But as he increases the amount of fertilizer he uses the increase in output will decrease per unit of additional fertilizer. If the farmer adds too much fertilizer, it will actually result in a decrease in production. “Classical economists such as Malthus and Ricardo attributed the successive diminishment of output to the decreasing quality of the inputs. Neoclassical economists assume that each ‘unit’ of labor is identical. Diminishing returns are due to the disruption of the entire productive process as additional units of labor are added to a fixed amount of capital.”[105](#sdfootnote105sym) The classical economists’ formulation is closer to what I am driving at. For instance, when agriculture was invented the first time a farmer planted on the land it was very fertile. However, successive plantings on the same soil resulted in less output because nutrients in the soil were depleted. On a species level, as the population grew due to agriculture, people were forced to farm land that was less fertile. In both cases, the quality of the inputs decreased.

The second law of thermodynamics is often described as the “arrow of time.” This is usually explained by example. For instance, if you drop a glass on a tile floor it breaks. However, you never see the reverse where shards of glass jump together from a floor to form a glass that then lands on the table. With energy, we can lower the entropy level, but usually it is not a direct reversal of the process. For instance, we can grind up the glass and use it as feedstock for a new glass, and this reduces the entropy, but it is not a reversal of the arrow of time. What this means is that processes tend to create waste products, and the supply of inputs become more scarce (lower quality). This results in diminishing returns on a macro scale for any process and applies to biological processes. For instance, yeast, when used to create wine or spirits, will either run out of sugar or produce so much alcohol they die.

Many of the biggest policy debates today are animated by this phenomenon. This debate takes the form of we are either going to run out of resources, or we are going to create too much waste (pollution). Proposed solutions include conservation and sustainability. Conservation is not really a solution; it is an attempt to slow the process. Sustainability is an attempt to overcome, or at least manage, diminishing returns. There are numerous and conflicting definitions of what sustainability means. However, most sources point to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), also known as the Brundtland Report. According to the 1987 Brundtland Report, sustainability is: "Meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs." This definition is not testable and is incredibly vague. What are the “needs” of the present generation? Do we need the Internet, satellites, SUVs, etc.? How do we know if this will compromise future generations’ ability to meet their needs?

Since this is not a productive path of inquiry, let’s take the word “sustainable” literally. A sustainable technology would be one that can be used indefinitely by humans without side effects and without any diminution in its effectiveness. It is clear from the discussion above this violates the second law of thermodynamics. Any use of technology at least produces waste heat—a side effect. Sustainability, taken literally, is an attempt to create a perpetual motion machine. Even the Sun’s energy will not last forever; it is not infinite. Is the sustainability movement unrealistically optimistic?

A key issue for the sustainability movement is the use of so-called non-renewable resources, such as the use of fossil fuels and the using up of other natural resources (diminishing returns). The way this is often phrased today is peak oil, peak water, peak (pick your favorite resource). Peak oil occurs when the amount of oil that can be extracted reaches its maximum or the point at which we reach the maximum net energy output from oil. The alternative definition takes into account that even if we can extract more oil, this is irrelevant if it takes more energy to extract the oil than we receive from the oil. The supposed solution to our peak oil problem is to develop renewable energy resources. The Clean Energy Initiative website provides the following definition “Renewable energy is natural energy, which does not have a limited supply. Renewable energy can be used over and over again, and will never run out.”[106](#sdfootnote106sym) What is a natural energy? Either all energy is natural, comes from nature, or only animal muscle power is natural. The natural qualification is complete nonsense—unless they really want us to go back to animal muscle only. The “never run out” qualification violates entropy. All energy resources will run out. All energy sources, fossil fuels, solar, hydroelectric, tidal, biomass, hydrothermal, fission, fusion, etc. are solar or at least stellar. For instance, hydroelectric energy is the result of the Sun heating the oceans or other large bodies of water. As the water evaporates and then condenses in the form of rain or snow on landmasses, it is collected in dams. The dams convert the gravitation force of the water into electric energy. Fossil fuels are created by plants converting sunlight into biomass. The biomass is trapped underground by sea sediment, and the pressure and heat convert the biomass into oil, coal, natural gas, etc.[107](#sdfootnote107sym) Fission is the process whereby heavy elements, generally Uranium, are split into lighter elements and energy is released. These heavy elements were created in a star that has long since expired. Thus, all energy is solar or, at least, stellar. The Sun will not last forever and does not provide unlimited energy. The concept of renewable energy that “will never run out” and “can be used over and over again” is untenable. So was Malthus correct? Are humans doomed by entropy to eventually return to the Malthusian trap or worse? Is the defining characteristic of economics that diminishing returns (entropy) will always force humans back to the point that we are on the edge of starvation?

This concept of peak resources is not new. You can find numerous examples similar to peak oil historically. For instance, the fertilizer crisis of the 19th century. In 1830, it was discovered that bat guano was an excellent fertilizer. The population exploded, as guano was used in Europe. The best sources of guano began to run out fairly quickly. People predicted the equivalent of peak guano. However, the real question was not whether we would have peak guano, but peak fertilizer. In other words, we did not have a guano problem; we had an invention problem. The Haber-Bosch process was invented in 1909, which allowed fixing nitrogen in air and solved the peak guano problem.[108](#sdfootnote108sym)

_Reason_ magazine, in the article “Peak Everything?”, discussed how logical, scientific projections showed we would run out of lithium, neodymium, and phosphorus.[109](#sdfootnote109sym) Peak lithium was going to limit the batteries necessary for electric cars. In fact, we would run out of lithium faster than we would run out of oil. The solution is a new invention that replaces lithium with zinc air batteries. Note, the solution was not a better way to extract lithium, but to make the supply of lithium irrelevant. New inventions can create paradigm shifts. Peak neodymium is going to limit our ability to build the electric motors of hybrid cars, as well as other products. Interestingly, neodymium magnets were invented to overcome the problem of peak cobalt. In the area of permanent magnets, it appears that a new induction motor will eliminate the need for permanent magnets. Peak phosphorous is a repeat of peak guano. Peak phosphorous threatens our ability to provide enough fertilizer for our agricultural needs. One solution is to exploit human waste. Phosphorous is a byproduct of human urine. The phosphorous can be recycled using a no-mix toilet.

The computer industry has also been beset by predictions of impending doom, when it could no longer achieve Moore’s law of doubling the number of transistors every eighteen months. Ray Kurzweil has shown that if you restate Moore’s law as computational power, every time a technology reaches its limit to improve computational power, a new technology takes over. Using this, he shows that computational power has been growing exponentially since 1900. The first computational devices were electromechanical. When these devices reached their limit, they were replaced with relay devices; these were replaced with vacuum tubes, then transistors, and finally integrated circuits.[110](#sdfootnote110sym) However, if you trace the speed of machines beginning with the invention of the steam engine, it peaks at around supersonic flight. It is difficult to determine if this is an economic/technological limitation or a political limitation.

Diminishing returns are the result of the arrow of time part of the second law of thermodynamics that results in lower quality inputs and more waste outputs. These issues can be modeled as a decaying exponential in production in a technologically static environment. This is illustrated by looking at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The first coal was easy to extract. The coal was near the surface. As people mined the coal, the mines got deeper making it harder and more costly to extract. But more importantly, at some point the mines would fill up with water. Extracting this water by hand in buckets was expensive and time-consuming. The quality of the inputs, coal or coal mines, was lower, which resulted in diminishing returns for mining coal without new inventions. And that is where the steam engine came in.

  
  

# Chapter 13: Are Inventions Subject to Diminishing Returns?

Every invention is a combination of known elements. As a result, every invention opens the possibility of more inventions by building on earlier inventions, which was explained in the set law of inventions. Creating these inventions takes energy, but the number of potential inventions we can conceive of increases with every invention we create. As a result, the number of potential inventions grows factorially. There are four ways in which inventions could be subject to diminishing returns: 1) the total number of inventions are limited, 2) the inventions in a narrow area of technology are limited 3) the returns on devoting more resources, as a percentage of total resources, to inventing declines, and 4) the cost of creating the next invention in any technology could increase compared to its return.

We have shown in the set law of inventions that the number of potential inventions is not limited, and it is very unlikely that there are limits to the number of actual inventions.

Inventions in a narrow area of technology are likely subject to diminishing returns. Ray Kurzweil has studied this and found that new technologies appear to follow an S-curve with the greatest return in the middle of the S and eventually declining in return.[111](#sdfootnote111sym) Jacob Schmookler also noticed this. Cross-pollination between the primary area of technology and other areas of technology appears to prevent diminishing returns in a narrow area of technology, similar to how substitute resources prevent diminishing returns for natural resources.[112](#sdfootnote112sym)

If a greater and greater percentage of a country’s, or the world’s, resources were devoted to discovering inventions, would it hit a point of diminishing returns? No country has ever come close to testing this hypothesis. Countries throughout history have underinvested in inventions and provided little or no incentive for inventors. Those countries that have devoted the most resources to inventing have seen the greatest economic returns. The U.S. has historically devoted the most resources to invention. It has historically had the strongest laws protecting the rights to inventions, which has resulted in greater resources being devoted to invention. England had some of the strongest laws protecting inventors at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and it was the hotbed of invention at that time. There is a minimum amount of resources that must be devoted in a country to agriculture, manufacturing, and maintenance. If inventive activity were so large as to crowd out those activities, then the world might hit a point of diminishing returns for inventing.

The idea that the cost per invention could increase to the point of diminishing returns seems to have credence if we look at a narrow technological area. For instance, the cost of improving the aerodynamics of airplanes is extraordinarily expensive. However, modern electronics allow us to improve the aerodynamics of planes by putting in control systems that allow a plane to be unstable aerodynamically. Commercial supersonic flight was not feasible economically in the 1970s because of aerodynamic drag. This problem can be solved today fairly inexpensively with electronic control systems. The cost of inventing in electronics grew tremendously with the advent of the integrated circuit. However, the advent of personal computers and software has driven down the cost of inventing in electronics and a wide variety of other areas. There is evidence that the cost of inventing is decreasing over time if we do not limit inventing to a narrow area of technology.

Diminishing returns can be modeled as a decaying exponential as explained above. In a technologically stagnant society, entropy or diminishing returns will prevail. Inventing is the key to escaping the Malthusian trap and growing real per capita income. Inventions across all areas of technology are not subject to diminishing returns. Potential inventions grow factorially, which is much faster than diminishing returns shrink. Thus, it is entirely possible to grow our technology faster than the limitations of diminishing returns and the second law of thermodynamics. However, it is not foreordained that humans will invent. Humans are volitional beings, and they can choose not to invent. Systems that protect inventors’ rights to their inventions are key to ensuring we invent faster than entropy erodes our ability to produce.

  
  

# Chapter 14: Intellectual Capitalism

_Unfortunately, neoclassical as well as classical economics seems better adapted to the analysis of replication than to that of technological change. The vast economic changes since the Stone Age, or for that matter during recent centuries in the West, were possible only because of technological progress._

—Jacob Schmookler

This chapter integrates this information into the foundations of an economic school of thought. I will discuss not only the major tenants, but also some of those concepts from other areas of economics that are not part of intellectual capitalism. Marx was the person who coined the term capitalism and like so many things, he got it wrong. In fairness to Marx, most of the classical economists placed their emphasis on the creation of capital as the key to understanding the economy also.

All capital is intellectual capital. Humans are rational animals[113](#sdfootnote113sym) and use this ability to think, to create inventions that alter their environment in a way that improves the chances of their survival. The source of savings that can be used as capital is invention that provides a profit. Classical economics confused the cause with the effect and assumed that the source of inventions was capital. The most important input to an economy is its inventions or the minds of humans.

Increasing the level of technology is the only way to increase real per capita income or wealth of large groups of people. The only long-term way to increase the level of technology is to create new inventions. An invention is a human creation with an objective result. There are a number of natural laws of inventions. For instance, an invention is always a combination of existing and known elements; an invention uses and obeys natural phenomena and/or laws; and usually builds on earlier inventions. Invention precedes production and production precedes consumption. The natural laws of invention show that the rate at which inventions are created is related to how free people are and aligns itself with policies based on natural rights.

This book defines economics as the study of how people obtain the things they need to survive. There is no distinction between mere survival and thriving. The idea that because you have enough food for a day, or a week or a year, that economics is not about survival is short sighted. All the evidence shows that one’s standard of living is related to how long one will survive. This is partly because almost no one has everything they will need to live forever. For instance, think of all the food, medical care, shelter etc., you will need for the rest of your life. This amount of resources exceeds all but less than one percent of the people in the world. Also, one’s standard of living determines one’s chances of surviving natural disasters, illness, and other disruptions.

This definition of economics makes it clear that economics applies to Robinson Crusoe (a person on a deserted island). When we look at Robinson, we see that profit is necessary for him to sustain his life. A number of errors in economics are immediately apparent when using Robinson Crusoe economics. For instance, the idea that increasing the money supply results in economic growth. Increasing the money supply is a nice way of saying counterfeiting. If Robinson prints money, he still has exactly the same resources (less some paper and ink) and the same needs he had before, except he has wasted calories (his currency) on this activity.

Patents, which are property rights for inventions, are the single most important policy for increasing real per capita income. Patents cannot exist in a vacuum; they are part of a system of property rights. The only valid conceptual framework for property rights is natural rights. Natural rights, updated for modern language, is the logical system that evolves from the fact that you own yourself. This logical system can be almost as precise as Euclidean geometry. The logical system of natural rights explains almost all of our property laws, our contract laws, and common law criminal laws.

The advent of the modern patent system corresponded with, and was the reason for, the escape from the Malthusian trap by large numbers of people. The first modern patent system was created in the United States; however, Great Britain had a patent system that was somewhat effective before the United States. Many countries in Europe and throughout the world copied the United States’ patent system in the 19th century.

Technologically backward countries can increase their level of technology without creating new inventions. Thus, patent systems are less important to them. What they need are rules that allow the free flow of capital and people to acquire existing technologies. However, a rational patent system would not be country specific. It would be absurd if when I drive into Canada from the United States I lose the right to my car. I do not lose the copyright to my book, but I lose the patent right to my invention.

The present patent system in the United States and most of the world has been perverted into a crony system designed to favor large corporations and the politically connected. Aside from a worldwide patent, a rational patent system would start with the proper definition of an invention. Our present laws confuse what an invention is, with who is the inventor among other problems. There is not space in the book to explain all the problems or fixes to our present patent system, but it would start by properly defining what an invention is and who is an inventor. For more information, see the appendix on how to fix the patent system.

A big part of the misunderstanding of patents among economists is the failed concept of perfect competition. Capitalism is not perfect competition. Perfect competition leads to wealth destruction and falling back into the Malthusian trap. Perfect competition cannot differentiate between a property right and government granted monopoly. Perfect competition requires the elimination of the human mind from the market. It is not surprising that the analysis of patents fares poorly under perfect competition. The Industrial Revolution would never have happened if government policies in the United States and Great Britain were geared to ensure perfect competition. If you eliminate every product in your house or office that was subject to a patent or made by a patented process, your house or office would not be standing. Patents have been instrumental in defining our modern world.

Proponents of perfect competition suggest it promotes allocative efficiency. There is no evidence for this. The efficiency of an economy is the median income divided by a subsistence wage. The most efficient economies are those with the most technology, the most patents, and the most people producing unique products. Capitalism and income growth are not about competition; they are about invention. To the extent we want people competing, we want them competing to produce new inventions and products based on these inventions.

Antitrust laws based on perfect competition have inhibited the development of systems to transfer patent rights efficiently. Governments have used antitrust laws to attack patent licensing generally, such as the nine no-nos of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States in the 1970s, but also organizations to hold patents that collect and distribute royalties. This topic diverges too much from the main thrust of this book to be discussed in detail. Antitrust policies have inhibited the development of new inventions and a market for the profession of inventing.

Our accounting systems fail to account in our businesses or in the economy for the value of inventions. They allocate all of the returns from inventions to the manufacturing process. This has resulted in overvaluing manufacturing and undervaluing inventions. As Nathan Myhrvold says, inventions are funded under a charity model today.

A fundamental concept of economics is diminishing returns. The book shows that this is related to the concept of entropy. All life, not just human, is in some sense a struggle to overcome the entropy law. Until Homo sapiens came along, the way life overcame this was through genetic evolution. Humans alter their environments, unlike any other lifeform, to suit their needs. The way humans do this is by inventing things, such as shelter, spears, nets, etc. If humans did not invent, then the study of economics would be the same thing as studying the evolution of Homo sapiens.

Because of entropy or diminishing returns, a technologically stagnant economy will regress to the Malthusian trap or stay stuck in it. Inventions across all technologies are not subject to diminishing returns. Diminishing returns result in an exponential decay, whereas possible inventions grow factorially and are infinite. As a result, the way to overcome diminishing returns or entropy is to have policies that encourage inventing, which includes patents and those policies consistent with natural rights. The United States, not surprisingly, was founded on natural rights. The principles of natural rights are the foundation of our Declaration of Independence, but also underlie our common law. William Blackstone’s _Commentaries_ formed the basis of common law in the United States and his analysis was based on Locke’s natural rights. For the same reason, natural rights form the basis of most common law countries.

Real environmental concerns cannot be solved by sustainability or conservation; they can only be solved by inventions. The countries that pollute the least are those that are the most technologically advanced. Inventions are often directed at using these waste products. For instance, oil was something undesirable to have on your land in the early 1800s; it made your land not arable. Then, with the advent of methods of refining crude oil, it became valuable and saved the whales from being wiped off the face of the earth. When I was a kid, natural gas was considered a waste product by refineries and they always had a torch burning off its excess. Today, it is a highly valuable commodity.[114](#sdfootnote114sym)

In any free market or market areas, the cost of products will decline over time, or the capabilities will increase for the same price. The electronics industry is the poster child for this, but this can also be seen across the whole economy in the United States during the late 1800s. The two things that stop this process are regulations (rules that are preemptive in nature or inconsistent with natural rights) and inflation. One example of regulation in the United States driving up prices is building codes and zoning laws. These rules have killed off new inventions in the building industry. They have also entrenched building practices from the 1960s and 1970s and entrenched the large companies that provide the products for this technology. People in the United States think it is natural that the prices of their homes should appreciate. In fact, they are convinced that houses are an investment because of these policies, instead of a depreciating asset. They believe rising prices for homes is a good thing. This is not true for any other products or services. The American people have been duped on this issue.

The introduction of money or currency often leads to nonsense in economic thinking. For instance, the multiplier effect explains that if the government spends X amount of money then the economy grows by 3X, and if a private sector actor spends X, then the economy grows by 4X. The reasoning for this is that the person who receives the money, then goes out and spends some of that money with other people and so on. If this were true, we could be infinitely rich by just having the government spend an infinite amount of money. Even the most adamant Keynesians had to abandon the 3X multiplier, but now they talk about multipliers of 1.15X. However, the absurdity of the situation is the same, with infinite spending causing infinite wealth. Beyond that, if you trade a gallon of milk for a dozen eggs, how can that possibly result in a 4X increase in the economy? If your production of milk does not increase and neither does the person raising eggs, then there is no change in the economy. We know that the only way to increase real per capita GDP is by increasing your level of technology, which ultimately means creating new inventions.

There is a lot of confusion about central banks (the Federal Reserve in the United States), fractional reserve banking, and legal tender laws. The discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this book. Suffice it to say that manipulating the money supply cannot cause real per capita increases in income or wealth and even sound money by itself does not create wealth; it just keeps it from being destroyed.

Intellectual capitalism is founded on the unique nature of human beings, which is that we are capable of reasoning. Resources are not given to humans. They must acquire them with their own efforts. Humans are capable of altering their environment unlike any other living organism, and they do this by creating inventions, which are the ultimate source of economic growth.

  
  

# Chapter 15: Interview with the Future

This is a fictional interview with a Mr. Farnsworth from the future. It is set fifty years after the ideas of this book have been incorporated into the laws and policies of governments.

Interviewer: Mr. Farnsworth, have the people of the United States, or more generally the world, experienced economic growth as a result of these ideas?

Farnsworth: Absolutely.

Interviewer: Care to elaborate?

Farnsworth: We are experiencing growth rates of your Asian tigers. In fact, we are finding that Ray Kurzweil is right, and our growth rates are accelerating.

Interviewer: You must have huge manufacturing companies.

Farnsworth: Actually no. Most manufacturing is done on site with advanced versions of what you called 3D printers. Of course, there are companies producing the feedstocks for these personal manufacturing devices, but they are small by the standards of your day. It turns out that large manufacturing companies were the Luddites of the 21st century.

Interviewer: How so?

Farnsworth: Well, they argued that all wealth came from manufacturing and in an attempt to protect their markets, they attacked the profession of inventing. Eventually, reason and 3D printing won the day.

Interviewer: What about farming and the food companies?

Farnsworth: Food is now 3D printed in the home or restaurant. Some farms are kept alive as museums. It took a while for people to get used to printed food, but creative chefs began making all sorts of interesting flavors, and this caused acceptance to grow. Imagine being able to define exactly the marbling and type of steak, cooked exactly as you like it.

Interviewer: So if the manufacturing and the food sectors do not employee many people, where do people work?

Farnsworth: Most people work for themselves. They combine together in small teams to take on projects. When the project is over, they form up in new teams to take on new projects, sort of like a pickup game of basketball. About 50% of the population works in the creative fields of inventing and art. For instance, an inventor or inventor team creates all the products we produce in our personal manufacturing devices. They receive a fee or royalty for each instance of the device that is realized.

Interviewer: That must be a very difficult way to make a living. I mean royalty rates can only be a small part of the overall cost.

Farnsworth: Actually, most of the cost of producing anything is this fee that goes to the inventors or artists, often 70% or more. The value added is not in the manufacturing but in the design.

Interviewer: It must be hard to clear all the overlapping IP rights. There must be a huge number of patent lawsuits.

Farnsworth: There are companies that specialize in clearing IP rights, sort of like your American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers except that they cover inventions. Working for one of these companies is considered a great place for a budding inventor to work as is the Patent Office. Once the nonsense of antitrust laws was removed, the market quickly created a system for clearing patent rights inexpensively and efficiently. Of course, that does not mean there are no patent lawsuits, but they are the exception.

Interviewer: So who are the wealthiest people in your society? Is it Wall Street financiers? Lawyers? Doctors?

Farnsworth: (laughs) I almost forgot about Wall Street. Once the financial regulations were lifted, Wall Street disappeared.

Interviewer: But investment bankers are still the kingpins of industry?

Farnsworth: No. First of all, the large amounts of capital that were required for the enterprises of an industrial enterprise are no longer necessary. Second, people are no longer required to use bankers to jump through regulatory hoops to raise capital. Most capital is raised through informal networks. The people providing capital compete to fund projects, particularly inventions. In our world, it is the financiers who scramble and pitch inventors. It is understood in my world that the real value created in this world is by the talent.

Interviewer: What about lawyers then?

Farnsworth: Being an attorney is considered a respectable, middle-class job. But it is not considered glamorous or a way to become wealthy. It is usually the sort of job someone who is not ambitious or only moderately talented would select. With the stability in our laws, the so-called creativity of lawyers of your day no longer exists. Being a patent attorney is considered a good profession for a budding inventor, however.

Interviewer: As wealthy as your country is, your politicians must be very powerful and important.

Farnsworth: Politicians are considered caretakers, minor functionaries, sort of like hiring a gardener or property manager. If you think about it, most of what politicians do or should do is a caretaking sort of position.

Interviewer: But the politicians control the laws and how the nation’s tax dollars are spent.

Farnsworth: The scope of actions that politicians can take in my world is very limited. The total cost of all government is less than 3% of GDP. This may sound fantastic to you, but this was also true during the first 100 or so years of the United States and many other countries at that time. We do not allow the freewheeling, politician-serving projects you allow. Any politician or bureaucrat who oversteps their bounds is swiftly rebuffed by the nearest private citizen. Private citizens are above the politicians. Very few people pay attention to politicians unless they attempt to violate the scope of their duties. I doubt if half the people know the president’s name.

Interviewer: Who are the wealthiest people in your world?

Farnsworth: Inventors. Because of the tremendous growth in the economy, the wealthiest people today are very rarely the wealthiest people in a couple of years. Successful artists also become very wealthy but are not in the same class as inventors.

Interviewer: What about sports stars?

Farnsworth: They do very well, but not as well as artists do. There is not a single person on the Forbes 400 who made or inherited their wealth from manufacturing, distribution, finance, or the extraction industries in my world.

Interviewer: What about the poor? I mean there must be huge income gaps. Housing must be very expensive.

Farnsworth: No one is truly poor unless they were born with very limited mental abilities and have no family or have alienated everyone in their life. Housing is a very small part of anyone’s budget in my world. New inventions drove the price of housing down mercilessly.

Interviewer: What about medical care and extended illnesses? I mean, medical care can be very expensive.

Farnsworth: Yes, occasionally people are ill for extended periods of time, and they cannot work. But it is the fact that they cannot work, not the cost of health care, that puts them in a precarious financial situation. Healthcare costs plummeted once government got out of the business and inventors entered. New healthcare inventions monitor your body continuously, tracking sugars, electrolytes, endocrine levels, etc. and immediately take steps to correct any imbalances or alert the person that they need additional help. Other bloodstream devices target cancer cells, and others can do minor repairs to damaged muscles and tissue, Not to mention all the new genetic therapies.

Interviewer: Wow. Are people happier?

Farnsworth: (Smiles) Wealth doesn’t buy happiness?

Interviewer: Exactly.

Farnsworth: I’ve got to go now. But I will just say that in my world the opportunities are almost limitless. These opportunities allow young people to become an expert in new fields in several years. We have what you would consider almost limitless opportunities both in our careers and as consumers. In my world things are constantly changing, we’re not burdened with endless arbitrary rules, laws are stable, understandable, and predictable, and we pay almost nothing in taxes. What do you think?

# Appendix: Inventions and Art

This appendix delves further into the question of what is an invention and what is art mainly by way of examples.

1) Is fire an invention?

Fire exists a priori to man or separate from man so it is not a human creation and, therefore, not an invention. However, the ability to light a fire by rubbing two sticks together is a human creation, and it has an objective result, so it is an invention. Techniques for creating fire, controlling fire, and transporting fire are human creations with objective results, so they are inventions.

2) Is mathematics an invention?

Mathematics (excluding applied math) is a logical system that exists separate from man, much like gravity exists whether we know about it or not. Mathematics is the process of uncovering a logical system, for instance, Euclidean geometry or algebra. As a result, mathematics is not a human creation. This is true despite the fact that there are objective answers to mathematical problems. However, when a mathematician describes what they have uncovered this is art because it is a human creation but it does not have an objective result. The description of the math will do nothing by itself and has a different reaction by different observers, often, confusion in most observers but not in those skilled in that area of math.

Applied mathematics is not a logical system that exists separate from man. It is a human creation. For instance, there are several methods for calculating the sine of an angle. Therefore, they are human creations, but they do nothing by themselves. In other words, they have a subject result and are, therefore, art.

3) Is a computer program an invention?

A computer program is a sequence of written commands. This sequence of written commands is clearly a human creation. However, the program does nothing by itself, so it has a subjective result and is, therefore, art and subject to copyright laws. In the language of patent law, computer programs per se are not patentable (inventions).

When a computer program is executed by a computer, however, it does have an objective result. For instance, it might determine the sine of an angle or sort names into an alphabetical order. Thus, software executed by a computer is an invention.

  
  

# Appendix: Fixing the Patent System

As stated earlier, there is not enough space in this book to explain a proper patent system that protects the property rights of inventors. However, I will highlight some of the bigger issues and their solutions. The most important change is to correctly define what an invention is. In United States law, this would require a change to 35 U.S.C. § 101 to state that an invention is a human creation with an objective result. This should be determined based on the description of the invention and not the claims of a patent. I will divide the rest of this appendix into the groups of litigation, obtaining a patent, and business issues.

Litigation

While the talk of a patent litigation explosion has been shown to be false multiple times, it is a legitimate complaint that patent lawsuits are too expensive and take too long. However, this is not a problem confined to patent lawsuits. The federal rules of procedure allow litigators to go on multi-year discovery explorations in the name of getting to the truth. The reality is that litigators use this to spend the other side into submission or just to pad their fees. As a result, some litigators threaten litigation and then force innocent parties to settle because of the potential costs of litigation. However, this is not confined to patents. It is used in medical malpractice lawsuits, securities litigation, product liability litigation, and by government agencies such as the EPA, SEC, OSHA, etc. The rules on discovery for federal lawsuits should be tightened and severely time limited. This would go a long way to reducing the cost and time of all federal lawsuits.

The presumption of validity in patent cases has become a joke, which means that every patent lawsuit reexamines this issue. In order to show a patent is invalid at trial, the defendant should have to show that the claims are not novel and the court should do everything possible to try to preserve an interpretation of the claims that make them valid. However, vague claim drafting or vague wording in the specification should be construed against the patentee, just as it is in the case of contracts.

The duty to disclose prior art to the patent office should be withdrawn. Failure to comply with this duty, which is called fraud on the patent office, can result in your patent being invalid, which is why litigators spend years and millions of dollars in discovery looking for a smoking gun. This rule also tends to be redundant. If the prior art found by the defendant invalidates the patent, then the inventor’s motives are irrelevant and if the prior art does not invalidate the patent, then we should not allow defendants to use this as an excuse to invalidate the property rights of the inventor. This change would significantly reduce the amount of discovery and, therefore, the cost and time of litigation.

All antitrust analysis of patents should be considered invalid. Patents are property rights, and the present antitrust laws should be repealed for the reasons explained earlier. Only government-granted monopolies (duopolies, etc.) should be outlawed, as was the case with the Statute of Monopolies. Any court decision that uses any antitrust type analysis should be immediately considered an invalid decision and litigators who try to introduce this line of reasoning should be sanctioned.

We need special patent courts or, at least, all patent lawsuits should be done by attorneys who have a technical background and have prosecuted patent applications. In order to correctly decide any legal case, it is necessary to both understand the facts and the law, something that rarely happens in patent cases. Not one of the present Supreme Court justices has a technical background. They commonly do not understand the technology in the patent cases they review. In addition, they have no understanding of patent law. The reality is that none of the Supreme Court justices is legally or factually competent to try patent cases, and they have made a mess of patent law. The whole point of the 1952 Patent Act was to correct these sorts of errors on the part of the Supreme Court.

Obtaining a Patent

All new inventions are eligible for patent protection. The definition of an invention does not include “non-obviousness” as required in the United States or an “inventive step” as used in most of the rest of the world. The non-obviousness requirement is a logical contradiction if the word obviousness is taken literally. It is impossible for something that is novel, which means it did not exist before, to be obvious at the point in time when it was created. The non-obviousness requirement has resulted in all sorts of nonsense in patent law and was the result of unconstitutional activism on the part of the Supreme Court. For more information, see [Non-Obviousness: A Case Study in Judicial Activism](http://hallingblog.com/non-obviousness-a-case-study-in-judicial-activism/).

Some people have argued that mere novelty will result in trivial variations being patentable. Note that novelty here is related to inventions, so the claims must define a new invention, which means it is functionally different. Design patents and trade dress issues require that we differentiate between functional and esthetic features, so intellectual property professionals are already well schooled in defining these differences. Australia has novelty patents, and they appear to be working.

The publication of patent applications eighteen months after their earliest priority date should be repealed. A patent is a negotiation between the inventor and the government for their property rights. An inventor who does not like the deal he is obtaining should always be able to withdraw his application and keep his invention a trade secret.

The inventor is the first person to create an invention. The United States changed to a first to file with the passage of the America Invents Act (AIA). The whole of the AIA should be repealed. Note, there are some limited circumstance when a non-inventor can be the patent holder, and they relate to the situation where the inventor suppresses his invention, but that is a narrow legal exception.

Patents should be worldwide. One of the major problems with our patent system is that your rights stop at the border. This is different from any other property right. For instance, if I drive my car across the border into Canada, I still own my car. If I take my book across the border into Canada, I still own both the physical version of my book and the copyrights to my book. But, if I drive my invention across the border, I no longer own my invention. This situation existed for copyrights 150 years ago, and it was recognized that there was no logical reason for copyrights to end at a country’s border, and it discouraged the publication of domestic authors. The same is true of patents.

I suggest a system of reciprocity in which an inventor who obtains a patent in Canada, for example, has patent rights in the U.S. and vice versa. This would decrease the duplication of efforts across patent offices around the world and significantly reduce the present backlog in the U.S. Patent Office. More importantly, it would increase the value of a patent and increase the chance of obtaining funding for technology startups.

The US Patent Office (PTO) should be able to keep all the fees that it collects. The PTO should have a strict timeframe for examining a patent application, say six months. Failure to do so would result in the patent issuing.

All procedures to challenge patents that have multiplied in the United States, such as _inter partes_ reexamination, should be repealed. Third parties should have the ability to submit prior art that they believe is relevant to the validity of a patent.

The requirement to file prior art with the PTO should be withdrawn. In today’s world, the patent office’s ability to search the prior art is extremely powerful.

Maintenance fees or annuities should be eliminated. Maintenance fees are required to keep your patent in force and are a backhanded way to introduce a working requirement. In some countries, these fees make the patent system unavailable to all but the most wealthy people and corporations.

These reforms would reduce the cost and time of obtaining a patent. They would increase the value of obtaining a patent and open the patent system to more people. Finally, they would reduce the crony aspects of our current patent system.

Business Issues

The cost of clearing and trading rights in patents is too expensive today. In the middle 1800s, there were a large number of lawsuits over patents related to the sewing machine. The manufacturers and inventors got together and created a company to hold their patents, and everyone paid a royalty for access to these patents. The proceeds were paid out to the inventors based on the number and importance of their inventions. This was called a patent pool. The advent of the ideas embodied in the Sherman Antitrust Act resulted in government prosecutors breaking up patent pools.

In the copyright area, we have organizations such as BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC to quickly and inexpensively clear rights to songs. No such organizations exist for patents mainly because of the antitrust laws, which should be immediately repealed. The closest version of BMI for patents is industry standards organizations, but these organizations are focused on manufacturers, not inventors.

Because of the high cost and uncertainty of licensing patents, we have created a not-invented-here syndrome. Companies are both unwilling to license their patents and take licenses to other people’s patents. This results in underinvestment and dissemination of inventions or, worse, an attitude that stealing other people’s inventions is okay. Many of the present so-called patent reforms in the United States are designed to make it easier for big companies to steal other people’s inventions, while being able to enforce their patents because they have a larger war chest.

Patent clearance and licensing companies are absolutely a vital part of creating an efficient market for inventions, which will make us all wealthier and healthier.

Peter Meza, a brilliant patent attorney, has probably read more versions and had more discussion with me about this book than any other person aside from my wife. Vinay Kohhatkar, the publisher of the online magazine [Savvy Street](http://www.thesavvystreet.com/), encouraged me to finish this project and provided invaluable insight as a beta test reader. James Brenner, a professor of chemical engineering and entrepreneur, provided excellent insight into the more technical aspects of the book, particularly the parts about entropy. Keith Werner, head of the [Gold Standard Institute](http://goldstandardinstitute.us/) and PhD economist, provided superb insight into the more standard economic concepts. Ian Shepard, inventor and entrepreneur, also encouraged me to write this book and provided excellent feedback. I had a stunningly talented group of beta test readers who were invaluable. There are certainly numerous other people that I should thank who provided help and insight as I was working out the ideas in this book; however, I decided to focus on my beta test readers. It is not easy work being a beta test reader.

This book explains that U.S. innovation has been declining since the ‘90s. Innovation is the only method of obtaining real per capita growth. Since 2000, we have passed a number of laws and regulations that are killing innovation in the US. The incredible innovation of the ‘90s was based on technology start-up companies built on intellectual capital, financial capital, and human capital. All three of the pillars have been under attack since 2000. ![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu3375756m_tmp_b3a2983538919e3d.jpg)

Note that other studies show a slight positive correlation between population density and economic growth, but this does not show a causal relation. People will gravitate toward richer, faster growing areas. However, it is enough evidence to destroy the environmentalist claim that population increases result in poverty.

The author checked the math and it appears Romer understates the number of permutations. There are 118 elements in the periodic table. The number of permutation would be 118!, which is a number with 4 followed by 194 zeros. In reviewing other writings by Romer, it appears the author of the article forgot to include some of the limitations in Romer’s statement.

[30](#sdfootnote30anc) Romer prefers the word “recipes” to “inventions” perhaps because he believes the word invention implies all the complex definitions of patent law. However, I believe this leads to confusion. An invention that is never realized in physical form is meaningless. Once it is realized in physical form, it has at least some of the rivalrous features of physical property.
