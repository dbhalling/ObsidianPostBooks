I have been accused of taking the Austrian School of Economics out of context. Rather than range all over the topic, I will address one Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek, primarily with respect to his epistemology. However, his sense of ethics follows directly from his epistemology so this will be discussed. As well, his metaphysics will be touched on.

My criteria of whether Hayek is a friend or foe will primarily focus on whether he is an advocate for reason (logic and evidence) as best defined by Rand and Locke. I focus primarily on Hayek’s Theory of Cultural Evolution, which lays out his ideas on epistemology. There are dozens of papers on this subject and below I will provide quotes from a number of papers that analyze Hayek’s theory.

  
  

Austrian economist, political philosopher, and winner of the 1974 Nobel memorial prize –[Hayek] spent a good part of his career developing a theory of cultural evolution. _According to this theory, rules, norms and practices evolve in a process of natural selection operating at_ _**the level of the group**_. Thus, groups that happen to have more efficient rules and practices tend to grow, multiply, and ultimately displace other groups. The theory, of which _Hayek himself was proud, is on all accounts central to his economic, social, and political project._ In the present paper, I explore the history of this theory of cultural evolution.

The History of Hayek’s Theory of Cultural Evolution, Erik Angner

Dept. of History and Philosophy of Science

  
  

It is clear from the quote above that ethics is a group level, not at the individual level. The ethics of a group are random and the dominate ethical rules are determined by some sort of evolutionary success. According to the paper this is not a side issue or something Hayek scribbled out that is separate from the rest of his ideas.

It is hard to believe that Rand or Locke would have been impressed with the idea that ethics are determined by the success of groups.

  
  

  
  

According to Hayek, _reason was not the driving force behind cultural evolution, but rather co-evolved in the course of this process_. (Emphasis Added)

Hayek’s Theory of Cultural Evolution a Critique of the Critiques, by Horst Feldmann

  
  

This paper suggests that reason is the result of cultural evolution just like ethics. It is hard to see Rand or Locke agreeing with this.

  
  

  
  

Hayek argues, however, that the demand for rational, conscious ("political") control of the concrete particulars of social life is based upon a misunderstanding of the process of cultural evolution and on a _hubristic and dangerous overestimation of the capacity of the conscious reasoning intellect._ _As we have seen, Hayek contends that civilization is not the creation of the reasoning mind, but the unintended outcome of the spontaneous play of innumerable minds within a_ _**matrix of nonrational values, beliefs, and traditions.**_ The desire of modern constructivists to "make everything subject to rational control" represents for Hayek an egregious **"abuse of reason" based upon a failure to recognize the limits to reason's sphere of competence**.63 Such limits, again, stem from the fact that reason is confronted by an immovable epistemological barrier: its irremediable ignorance of most of the particular, concrete facts that determine the actions of individuals within society. **The constructivist's main error is the refusal to recognize that reason is only competent in the realm of the abstract.** Hayek observes that the "rationalist . . . revolt against reason is . . . usually directed against the abstractness of thought [and] against the submission to abstract rules" and is marked by a passionate embrace of the concrete. He sums up the constructivist error in this way: "**constructivist rationalism rejects the demand for the discipline of reason** because it deceives itself that reason can directly master all particulars; and it is thereby led to a preference for the concrete over the abstract, the particular over the general, because its adherents do not realize how much they thereby limit the span of true control by reason."64 (Emphasis Added)

Hayek on the Role of Reason in Human Affairs, Linda C. Raeder, Palm Beach Atlantic University

  
  

“Matrix of nonrational values, beliefs, and traditions” are responsible for civilization? It is clear that Hayek does not think there is anything special about Natural Rights or the United States or any other country or their values. The best we can say is that it is the best based on its success at this time.

“Rejects the demand for the disciple of reason”? This sounds like it comes straight from an environmentalist or a modern socialist. It is clear that Hayek is not just talking about the limits of the knowledge of a central planner, he is attacking reason itself. The best possible spin is that Hayek is only attacking reason with respect to knowledge of human affairs, i.e., economics, social sciences, ethics, law, political structures, literature and the arts.

It is clear from Hayek’s rejection of reason that he does not agree with an Aristotelian or Objectivist idea of an objective reality that is knowable. At best Hayek’s metaphysics is consistent with Plato’s theory of forms, where we can only get a vague glimpse of reality.

  
  

"The picture of man as a being who, thanks to his reason, can rise above the values of civilization, in order to judge it from the outside . . . is an illusion."83 For Hayek, morals, values, and reason are entirely natural phenomena, evolutionary adaptations which have enabled man to survive and flourish in his particular kind of world.

Hayek on the Role of Reason in Human Affairs, Linda C. Raeder, Palm Beach Atlantic University

  
  

Does the first sentence above sound like Howard Roark or Ellsworth Toohey? Hayek is pushing the worst sort of collectivism. It is a collectivist attack on the mind itself, on the independence of the mind based on reason. Hayek would have stood hand and hand with the Catholic Church in condemning Galileo to death.

  
  

  
  

For Hayek, _the rules of morality and justice are the same as they were for David Hume: conventions_ that have emerged and endured because they smooth the coordination of human affairs and are indispensable, given the nature of reality and the circumstances of human existence, to the effective functioning of society.87 **For Hayek as for Hume the rules of morality and justice are not the products of reason** and they cannot be rationally justified in the way demanded by constructivist thinkers. And since our moral traditions cannot be rationally justified in accordance with the demands of reason or the canons of science, we must be content with the more modest effort of "rational reconstruction," a "natural-historical" investigation of how our institutions came into being, which can enable us to understand the needs they serve.88

Morality is not based on reason according to Hayek, it is based on convention. David Hume was the philosopher that came up with the ‘is-ought” problem in ethics that is the basis for moral relativism. Solving the “is-ought” problem was one of the major accomplishments Rand’s ethics.

Hume also attacked cause and effect and therefore reason, arguing that the best we can say about events is that they are closely related or probablistic. I consider Hume worse than Kant, partly because he is more understandable than Kant and because he inspired Kant. Here is what Rand had to say about Hume.

“If you observe that ever since Hume and Kant (mainly Kant, because Hume was merely the Bertrand Russell of his time) philosophy has been striving to prove that man’s mind is impotent, that there’s no such thing as reality and we wouldn’t be able to perceive it if there were—you will realize the magnitude of the treason involved.”

  
  

  
  

F.A. Hayek was the chief conduit through which Hume’s moral, political, and social theory entered the mainstream of modern libertarian thought. In his article “The Legal and Political Philosophy of David Hume” (originally presented as a lecture at the University of Freiburg on July 18, 1963), Hayek bemoaned the fact that Hume’s legal and political philosophy had been “curiously neglected.” In addition to being “one of the founders of economic theory” and the greatest British legal philosopher before Bentham, Hume “gives us probably the only comprehensive statement of the legal and political philosophy which later became known as [classical] liberalism.”

[http://www.libertarianism.org/columns/self-interest-social-order-classical-liberalism-david-hume](http://www.libertarianism.org/columns/self-interest-social-order-classical-liberalism-david-hume) Self-Interest and Social Order in Classical Liberalism: David Hume, by George Smith, formerly Senior Research Fellow for the Institute for Humane Studies, a lecturer on American History for Cato Summer Seminars, and Executive Editor of Knowledge Products. Smith's fourth book, The System of Liberty, was recently published by Cambridge University Press.

  
  

This clearly shows that David Hume was a big part of Hayek’s philosophical background. Bentham is Jeremy Bentham, who is considered the father of utilitarianism and is known for being an intellectual father of the utopian socialist movement in England.

  
  

  
  

Perhaps no other area of Burke’s and Hayek’s thought is as congruent as their understanding of the role of reason in human affairs; their views are so close as to suggest that Hayek’s thought on this issue is merely an elaboration, although quite an extensive one, of Burke’s theme. Hayek developed several of Burke’s most crucial insights: _1) the priority of social experience (or "tradition") over reason; 2) the notion that inherited social institutions embody a "superindividual wisdom"_ [_22_](http://www.nhinet.org/raeder.htm#n22) _which transcends that available to the conscious reasoning mind; and 3) the impotence of reason to ‘design’ a viable social order_.

Here is another attack on reason, an appeal to collective reasoning and another statement that reason is impotent.

  
  

  
  

Burke and Hayek, then, shared a common enemy as well as a common understanding: Enlightenment rationalism. Perhaps the most characteristic attribute of Enlightenment thought was its cavalier dismissal of ‘irrational’ tradition as mere superstition and prejudice.

This statement makes it clear that Hayek was anti-reason and anti-enlightenment.

  
  

  
  

Hayek, by contrast, is a critic of what he calls ―constructive rationalism.‖2 His concept of rationalism is somewhat idiosyncratic, and is not equivalent to Rand‘s conception of reason. _Nevertheless, it leads him to claim that ―no universally valid system of ethics can ever be known to us,‖3 which is obviously not consistent with her view._ For Hayek, moral rules have a status lying ―between instinct and reason.‖4 (Emphasis Added)

This is another case discussing how Hayek did not think that ethics were based on reason or that reason could ever tell us anything about ethics.

  
  

  
  

This case for market freedom is essentially negative. Hayek seems to think that if socialist planning were possible, socialism might be the morally ideal system. But the inescapable ignorance of would-be planners excludes that possibility: ―If there were omniscient men, if we could know not only all that affects the attainment of our present wishes but also our future wants and desires, there would be little case for liberty.‖10

Symposium: Rand and Hayek on Cognition and Trade

Rand versus Hayek on Abstraction

David Kelley The Atlas Society  
  
  

Hayek is not pro-liberty, at best he is pro-tradition, which is why it is not surprising to see so many religious people affiliated with the Austrian School of Economics. He is anti-reason and specifically bases his justification for ‘free markets’ on the limitations of reason generally and on the inability of reason to create or understand morals. His defense of the pricing mechanism of free markets is based not on liberty but on the idea of spontaneous order. More fundamentally, Hayek bases his justification of the pricing mechanism on tradition and utilitarian grounds.

Hayek’s metaphysics appear to be Platonic, which is incompatible with Rand and Locke. His epistemology is more consistent with Hume or Kant than Rand or Locke. You might argue that Hayek was only discussing the limits of reason with regard to social sciences, however at the least he applies it to all areas of human interaction, which includes ethics, the law, and the political realm. This means he is against Natural Rights and Locke, which means he is against capitalism. Capitalism is the economic system that arises when the law protects people’s natural rights, particularly their property rights. Hayek does not recognize property rights, at best he recognizes societies’ property conventions, which means he cannot understand capitalism. This is more than enough for me to damn Hayek as an enemy of capitalism and a foe.

In my opinion, Hayek’s esteem of Hume, Bentham, and Burke point to a much deeper antipathy to reason. His ethics is essentially majority rules with the modifier of natural selection. He specifically thinks it is the most absurd folly to think any one person can use reason to judge a society. This is consistent with his intellectual compatriots Hume and Burke. Hayek’s ethics is perfectly consistent with the moral relativists that say we cannot judge and an ISIS or a USSR or christianity. His ethics are antithetical to Rand’s and Locke’s. Hayek is clear that he does not think Natural Rights can be justified by reason and that Natural Rights cannot claim any special place in the world. Hayek is not a friend of reason, liberty, or capitalism. Rand’s estimation of Hayek is similar to mine, although I think I have spent much more time analyzing the issue.

  
  

  
  

  
  

  
  

I am willing to entertain any serious evidence that I have mischaracterized Rand or how the sources I am citing mischaracterized his arguments. I am not interested in unsubstantiated claims that I have misunderstood or mischaracterized Hayek. Do not complain that my standard is Rand and Locke, I told you that upfront. I am not interested in arguments that talk about other leading figures in the Austrian School of economics. Stick to the subject and provide actual evidence
