Now that we have some idea of what wealth and economic growth are (see What is Economic Growth? [http://hallingblog.com/what-is-economic-growth/](http://hallingblog.com/what-is-economic-growth/)), let’s look at some examples of what is not economic growth. When Tony slaughters a cow and eats it he has consumed some of his wealth. He has one less cow, but he has food in his belly that he needs to live. Is he wealthier now? Well he needs food to eat in order sustain his life. If he starves to death, he is certainly not wealthier. However, Tony now has less of what he needs to sustain his life in the future. Wealth is the surplus above what one needs to live today. Consumption is not wealth. Interestingly, being overweight was traditionally considered an indicator of wealth. The excess fat meant you could sustain yourself without eating for longer because you could not find food, or because you were sick and could not hold food down. In fact, it was fashionable for women and men to be overweight in the 1700 and 1800s. Fat was an indicator of wealth, both because the person could sustain themselves without food longer and because it indicated that the person had plenty of food, compared to the calories they consumed. In societies that live on the edge of starvation or what is called the Malthusian Trap, being overweight is a source of wealth.

The Malthusian Trap is named after Reverend Thomas Malthus (1766 -1836), who postulated that human population would always grow faster than the food supply, dooming humans to subsistence living, i.e., living on the edge of starvation. Oddly enough Malthus was correct until about the time he died. The advent of the Industrial Revolution changed this situation; first for the people of England and the US, then the West and today for at least half of the world’s population. The economist Gregory Clark has shown that policies to alleviate human suffering in a non-Malthusian Trap economy just result in additional misery in a Malthusian economy.[1](#sdfootnote1sym)
