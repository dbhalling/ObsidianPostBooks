Some people on galtsgulch do not seem to understand how software works. This website explains in detail how computers and software work down to the transistor level. A transistor when used in a computer is switch - that is the ones and zeros you have heard of. The transistor changes the direction that electricity flows, which means it changes the wiring. Software does nothing without hardware.

It is embarrassing that some people in the gulch have worked in software their whole life and they do not know how computers work.

I provide this information for those who might be honestly interested in this issue.

For those of you who are not computer oriented, think about the telephone system. In the old days you called a switchboard operator who used a patch panel to connect your telephone line to the person’s you were calling. This rewired the circuit, now providing a connection between you and the person you were calling. The switch board operator was replaced with electro-mechanical switch that could “interpret” the digits you dialed to a telephone line and connect your telephone line to the telephone line you called. Eventually these electro magnetic switches were replaced with transistors and elaborate logic circuits (a computer) replaced the electro-magnetic switches. When you dialed a number your programmed the telephone system to close a switch(es) between you and the number you called. Modern programming is much more complex, but it is essentially the same thing.
