I went to an Objectivist conference a while ago and a professor of philosophy was giving a talk. He told us that John Stuart Mill’s book, On Liberty, was a great book and we should re-read at least every other year. Here is what Ayn Rand said on point:

  
  

“[Mill’s] On Liberty is the most pernicious piece of collectivism ever adopted by suicidal defenders of liberty.”

“The social school of morality, exemplified by John Stuart Mill. Mill rejected the concept of individual rights and replaced it with the notion that the “public good” is the sole justification of individual freedom. (Society, he argued, has the power to enslave or destroy its exceptional men, but it should permit them to be free, because it benefits from their efforts.) Among the many defaults of the conservatives in the past hundred years, the most shameful one, perhaps, is the fact that they accepted John Stuart Mill as a defender of capitalism.”

This professor elsewhere has been an advocate of FA Hayek. Here is what Rand had to say about Hayek:

“Above all I would not recommend Hayek.”

Is this professor a proponent of Objectivism?

  
  

Would it surprise you if this professor was critical of patents?
