According to this [article](http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.mx/2012/08/rescuing-menger-from-austrians.html) Menger in “_Carl Menger’s Lectures to Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria_ (trans. Monika Streissler and David F. Good; Aldershot, 1994)” argues for:

**(1)** public works constructed by the state such as roads, railways and canals.

  
  

**(2)** government established agricultural and vocational training institutions (Menger 1994: 123).

  
  

**(3)** government subsidies to certain sectors

  
  

**(4)** state intervention to stop clearing of forests on private property in the mountains of Austria when this clearing had serious and bad effects on agriculture

  
  

**(5)** government intervention to stop child labour (Menger 1994: 129).

  
  

Carl Menger is often touted as the savior of Austrian Economics, but assuming all the above is true he is hardly a principled capitalist. In fact he sounds like a standard conservative who is against government intrusion in the economy until he is for it.
