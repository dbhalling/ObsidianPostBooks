# Preface

  
  

This book is about the science of economics that occurs by asking the question:

**What is the Source of Real per Capita Increases in Wealth?**

and following the scientific evidence to its logical conclusion. The book is divided into three parts. The first part explains the economic science that results from answering the question above. The second part is a copy of my book the Source of Economic Growth, which answers the questions of what causes real per capita increases in wealth and what caused the Industrial Revolution. The third part is a series of essays on various topics in economics.

The first part is a series of essays that start with the underlying philosophy of Intellectual Capitalism. At first it may seem strange that a science needs to define its underlying philosophy, however the other schools of economic thought are highly influenced by their underlying philosophy. As a result, the underlying philosophy of Intellectual Capitalism is stated explicitly. Next are a series of essays that explain how Intellectual Capitalism is applied to a number of standard economic issues. The book does not talk about rent control, or minimum wage because Intellectual Capitalism is an economics about increasing wealth and therefore about freedom. The answers to these questions and many similar questions should be apparent to any reader versed in freedom and capitalism. The last two essays are on Money and Banking. When money is introduced into economics people think magic happens. It is important to understand why this is not the case.

The second part of this book is my book the Source of Economic Growth. It has its own preface. This part is about the most important question in economics: What is the source of economic growth? It is concerned with real per capita increases in wealth or income, which is what matters to most of us. Surprisingly, very little attention has been paid to this question by the economics' profession.

The third part is a number of essays on economics. Most of these essays focus on Austrian Economics and its errors. Why does this book not spend equal time shooting down Keynesian and Socialist ideas? They do not pretend to be for free markets and capitalism. In many ways they do more damage than the Keynesians and Socialists, because they put forward incorrect positions in the name of capitalism and free markets. This section starts with the underlying philosophies of Classical Economics and Austrian Economics. Once you understand the underlying philosophy of Austrian Economics then the positions they take often follow fairly straight forwardly.

This is a science (real science not social science) of economics and like all real sciences there is always more work to be done and refinement of the ideas. For instance, the connections this book makes between biology and economics has barely been explored. Economic history has been under explored by the profession generally and now needs to be rethought in light of the ideas presented herein. A proper understanding of economics cannot be obtained without a proper understanding of property rights. Very few people have a proper understanding of property rights and this book just touches on this issue. The process of inventing and its importance have barely been explored.

It is my sincerest hope that this book will inspire you to take on some of this research.

  
  

  
  

  
  

# Part 1: Intellectual Capitalism

## Intellectual Capitalism: Philosophy

  
  

In my book **[Source of Economic Growth](http://www.amazon.com/Source-Economic-Growth-Dale-Halling/dp/1511829680/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1446314341&sr=8-2)** (Included as Part 2 of this book) I outlined a school of economics that I called Intellectual Capitalism. Most schools of economics do not explicitly state the philosophical foundations upon which they are based. In this post I will layout the philosophical foundations of Intellectual Capitalism by comparing it to the philosophical foundations of the major schools of economics.

  
  

Neoclassical

Most mainstream modern economics is based on the ideas of Adam Smith. Smith is part of the Scottish Enlightenment and this is key to understanding the philosophical basis of Smith’s and modern economics philosophical underpinnings. The father of the Scottish Enlightenment was Francis Hutcheson, who believed that we have moral senses (similar to vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch). This elevates emotions to valid epistemological tools. Adam Smith picked up on Hutcheson’s ideas in his book **[The Theory of Moral Sentiments](http://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_MoralSentiments_p.pdf)**.

Smith was also a close friend of David Hume, one of the giants of the Scottish Enlightenment. Hume argued that causation was an illusion and attacked induction as invalid. He also picked up on Hutcheson’s ideas on moral philosophy. Smith never explicitly states that he agrees with Hume, however they admired each other and Smith never rejects Hume’s ideas. The result is that economics is not based on the same “philosophy of science” (included in Part 3) as were the hard sciences of physics, chemistry, and biology. Furthermore it means that Smith and modern economics rejects Natural Rights, which are based on reason.

This rejection of the philosophy of science by economics, at least implicitly, in my opinion is one of the reasons modern economics has been stuck in the equivalent of pre-Newtonian physics.

  
  

Keynesian

This is perhaps the second largest school of modern economics and is named for John Maynard Keynes. Keynes was somewhat circumspect about his philosophical underpinnings, however it appears that Kant can be considered his most important philosophical influence. In the paper “**[The Philosophy of John Maynard Keynes (A Reconsideration)](http://www.persee.fr/doc/cep_0154-8344_1998_num_30_1_1220)**” by Elke Muchlinski he shows that Keynes and Kant shared a common epistemological approach.

His method provides a background for his conception of convention which still encompasses the fragility and precariousness of knowledge. Keynes rejected formal logic as inadequate for his purposes to outline the process of acquiring knowledge.

This should hardly be surprising as Keynes confuses cause with effect, by making consumption the key to the economy. It is clear that Keynes rejects the philosophy of science. Note there is only one correct philosophy of science, so I will no longer qualify that this was the philosophy of the hard sciences.[1](#sdfootnote1sym) If logic (and evidence) is precarious then the only other potential epistemological tool is emotion. The result is that Keynes also rejects Natural Rights as a valid moral theory.

  
  

Marxism

It is probably incorrect to consider the ideas of Karl Marx a school of economics, as it is really more a school of sociology. Marx greatest intellectual influence was Kant with a close runner up being Hegel. As a result, Marxists reject the philosophy of science, reason, and Natural Rights.

  
  

Austrians

The founder of Austrian Economics is Carl Menger who stated that the philosopher Franz Brentano was his biggest intellectual influence.[2](#sdfootnote2sym) Brentano is best known for his influence on psychology and Sigmund Freud. Brentano like the Scottish Enlightenment argues that emotions are valid epistemological tools. This appears to the basis for Menger’s subjective theory of values and prices in economics, which has been picked up by most of modern economics. It is important to note that when Menger and the Austrians talk about subjective values, they do not mean that each individual chooses for himself, they mean the choices are disconnected from reality.

It is clear the foundation of Austrian economics is antithetical to the philosophy of science. Their subjective theory of values is not limited to economic decisions but to all values, which means they also reject Natural Rights.

From Menger there are two slightly variations in modern Austrian Economics: Hayek and Mises

Hayek

F. A Hayek is a direct descendant of the Scottish Enlightenment and he set down his ideas on epistemology in his theory of cultural evolution. This theory explicitly rejects reason (logic and evidence – or the philosophy of science) as the source of knowledge. Instead Hayek substitutes that knowledge is gained and held collectively and not necessarily consciously. For more information see Hayek: Friend or Foe of Reason, Liberty and Capitalism? (Included in Part 3) As a result, Hayek also rejects the idea of Natural Rights.

Von Mises

Ludwig Von Mises’ equivalent of Hayek’s cultural evolution is praxeology which is the study of human action. Praxeology starts with an a priori theory of economics. From these fundamental axioms of human action all of economics can be derived without any reference to observation (empirical evidence). This makes praxeology part of philosophical rationalism and a system of math or logic at best. This means that praxeology explicitly rejects the philosophy of science. Because they reject the philosophy of science and adhere to the subjectivity of values and prices, they reject the idea of Natural Rights.

It is interesting that this rejection of empirical evidence allows Austrians to continue to advocate ideas that have been shown by empirical evidence to be incorrect. Among these are Australian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT) and their argument that intellectual property and patents in particular inhibit economic growth.

Despite praxeology’s rejection of empirical evidence, Mises and his follower vehemently reject mathematics in economics and also seem opposed to the use of formal logic in economics. This obvious contradiction escapes them. I will talk more about the role of mathematics in economics below. The Austrians’ criticism of some of the mathematical approaches to economics is correct, but not for the reasons they state.

Note that Murray Rothbard is alone in Austrian economics in advocating for Natural Rights, however he also accepts praxeology and the subjective theory of values and prices. These positions are completely contradictory.

  
  

Mathematics in Economics

There is a branch of mathematical economics that grew out of the Cowles Commission that attempts to use the mathematics of linear algebra to model the economy. Paul Romer is part of this group. The idea is that using linear algebra every variable (state) in the economy can be accounted for and therefore the whole economy can be modeled. The Austrians critique this approach is based on the limits of reason. However, that is not the problem with this area of economics. These mathematical models cannot take into account new technologies (inventions) and inventions are the most important thing that happens in the economy.

_Unfortunately, neoclassical as well as classical economics seems better adapted to the analysis of replication than to that of technological change. The vast economic changes since the Stone Age, or for that matter during recent centuries in the West, were possible only because of technological progress._

Jacob Schmookler

As the famous economist Jacob Schmookler points out above, this problem is not limited to mathematical economics.

Is mathematics appropriate in economics at all then? Yes mathematics is appropriate, when it is used correctly. Mathematics cannot just be used to make non-empirical hypothesis seem more scientific, and it is inappropriate to use mathematics to make heuristic models (think ptolemaic epicycles) at least without acknowledging it. Mathematics is only appropriate when it is the reflection of the underlying economic principles and empirical observations, it can never be the driver. This is a problem occurring in modern physics today also.

Econometrics is an attempt to make economics an objective empirical science and therefore when used appropriately is a valid tool of economics.

  
  

Intellectual Capitalism

It should be clear that Intellectual Capitalism is based on the philosophy of science. If you are uncertain what the philosophy of science is there is an overview in Part 3. This means that Intellectual Capitalism is grounded in human biology, evolution, and to some extent the ideas of entropy. I explain this in much more detail in Part 2, The Source of Economic Growth and in third chapter of Part 1. As a result, values and prices are objective (not to be confused with intrinsic). They are based on the fact that humans have certain objective needs and natures.

This brings up another point, which is that economics is not just a social science. It applies to a person on a deserted island. Intellectual Capitalism defines economics as the study of how people obtain the things they need to survive. There is no distinction between mere survival and thriving. The idea that because you have enough food for a day, or a week or a year, that economics is not about survival is short sighted. All the evidence shows that one’s standard of living is related to how long one will survive. This is partly because almost no-one has everything they will need to live forever. For instance, think of all the food, medical care, shelter etc., you will need for the rest of your life. This amount of resources exceeds all but less than one percent of the people in the world. Also one’s standard of living determines one’s chances of surviving natural disasters, illness, and other disruptions.

Intellectual Capitalism is the only school of economics that explicitly recognizes that man’s most important asset is his ability to reason (think) and this is true in economics also. This also means that Intellectual Capitalism is explicitly based on Natural Rights and therefore is consistent with the ideas of John Locke, Ayn Rand, and the founding ideals of the United States.

  
  

  
  

  
  

## Intellectual Capitalism: Fundamentals Part 1

  
  

Every science is defined by the questions it asks. According to a sampling of websites three of the major questions economics asks are:

1) What goods will be produced?

2) How will the goods be produced?

3) For whom are the goods produced?

Under free market capitalism (the system of economics that occurs when peoples’ natural rights are protected by the government ) the answers are: 1) those goods that produce a profit, 2) by the people who want to make a profit by producing them, and 3) for those people willing to pay for them. When I say pay for them, I mean by their own productive effort in producing other goods. Under any other political system the answer is the government and then economics boils down to the psychology of those people in power – in other words it is arbitrary.

These questions and answers are pretty boring and provide no great insight into the world. We could explore in more depth how the goods will be produced, but this is really a question of engineering and management. We could ask why those goods produce a profit and eventually we will start studying supply and demand, and pricing. These are the standard discussions of economics, however I still don’t think the questions being asked are very interesting of provide much insight.

The most important question in all of economics is:

What is the source of real per capita increases in wealth?

The second most important question in economics is:

What is the cause(s) of the Industrial Revolution?

The second question is important, because it is the first time in history that large groups of people escape the Malthusian Trap (living on the edge of starvation) and their incomes start to grow.

The answer to the first question is by increasing one’s level of technology, which can only be accomplished for the world as whole by inventions (human creations with objective results) the answer to the second question is Patents (property rights for inventions).

In Part 2, Source of Economic Growth**,** I provide copious evidence and logic for these answers and I will not repeat those here. In this article I want to layout some of the fundamental principles of my system of economics, which I call Intellectual Capitalism. These questions are much more profound than the ones posed by mainstream economics and more relevant to most people.

These questions and answers lead to a system of economics that is consistent with man’s unique nature - his ability to reason. When man applies his reason to the problems of survival he invents. Production, which is really about reproduction or replication, is not the driver in economics as the questions from mainstream economics imply. In economics the chain of cause and effect is:

  
  

Invention comes first, then Production, and then Trade or Consumption.

  
  

Keynesian economics focuses on consumption, so it is on the far wrong side of the cause and effect chain and as a result, almost everything taught by Keynesian economics is nonsense. Keynesians will make the argument that you will not produce the hamburger until I order it, so consumers are as important as producers. As I will explain in more detail below, try that living on a deserted island (Robinson Crusoe economics). Most of economics focuses on production, which is better than the Keynesians but is an intermediate step and not what causes economic growth. Generally, this branch of economics focuses on capital as the source of economic growth. This has been shown over and over to be a mistake. The paper that is given the most credit for showing capital is not the source of economic growth is Robert Solow’s “Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function.” As I show in Part 2 the capital theory of economic growth does not explain the Industrial Revolution. Some libertarians, such as Matt Ridley, have proposed that trade is the key to economic growth. This is almost as bad as the Keynesians on the scale of cause and effect. Other economists focus on monetary issues, such as central bank policies and financial markets. Money is a way of facilitating trade or a way of transferring capital and is not the source of economic growth. There have been inventions in finance that have contributed to economic growth including: fractional reserve banks, stock and bond markets, and limited liability corporations, among others.

Definition of Economics

With this background we can now define what the study of economics is: it is the study of how man obtains those things necessary to live. There is no rational distinction between living and thriving from an economic point of view. Some people objected that this definition is too broad. For instance, they argue that this might include the study of engineering. However, there is no reason to repeat other subjects and the various branches of engineering are not about the study of how people obtain the things they need, they are about how to apply science to solve various problems of invention, production, or distribution. However the study of invention is definitely part of the study of economics. Very little work has been done on the study of the process and principles of inventing. I have discovered six laws of invention discussed in Part 2.

An important point of this definition is that it makes it clear that Robinson Crusoe economics (a solitary man on a deserted island) applies. The cause and effect of economics is probably most clear in the case of Robinson Crusoe economics, it can also be useful for analyzing many other situations. For some reason when trade or money is added to economic discussions people think that magic happens. As a result, when you are analyzing a problem in economics and you get stuck, remove money (or trade) from the equation and most of the time this will make the situation clear.

Ethics in Economics

Many economists subscribe to the idea that if economics is going to be a science it needs to be value free (Note that this is expressing a value judgment itself). There is no such thing as a value free science. All sciences are built on an ethics and a philosophy. At a minimum this includes a commitment to the idea that there are not any supernatural forces as the cause of what we observe, a commitment to the existence of cause and effect, and the ethics to honestly report the data (evidence) and to follow the evidence to its logical conclusion. Some people may argue that this is not ethics or philosophy because these things are logical, however a sampling of history shows that this ethics is incredibly unique in the history of humans and even today.

Different sciences may have other philosophical/ethical foundations. For instance, medicine has the ethical limitation that doctors are not just studying the effect of diseases, injuries, poisons, etc. on the human body. Ethically doctors must use their knowledge to heal and save lives. In various tyrannical regimes there have been doctors who have studied the effects of poisons or injuries or even the lack of love/affection on babies and these doctors have all been universally and rightfully condemned.

Bad economic policies can cause more death and suffering than any doctor or group of doctors. One only need look at the hundreds of millions of deaths that have been caused by economic policies that promote the various forms of socialism. Economics is the study of how man obtains those things necessary to live. Just as it would be unethical for a doctor to purposely cause injury to a patient in order to study the effects on the human body, it is unethical for economists to prescribe economic poison for their personal gain, or just because they think if would make an interesting experiment. Thus the study of economics requires the ethical responsibility of searching for and prescribing policies that promote life.

Property Rights and Patents

This dispenses with the nonsense in economics for a need to define property rights in non-ethical terms. Defining property rights in utilitarian terms is actually going backwards in history to the time when property “rights” were arbitrary grants by the King (government). Property rights are an ethical concept and are earned by people when they create something useful for humans (or a single human). The scope of these property rights is limited by the value the person has created. The law may standardize some of these rights for practical reasons that are beyond the scope of this post.

Some people get confused about how this applies to employees or people who trade (buy) property. For instance, I buy a house and the associated land, how does this give me property rights in the house since I did not build it? The reason I have property rights in the house, is that I created something else of value, for instance let’s say a novel. I trade my novel which I have property rights in for gold (money, currency) and I trade this for the house. Part of my property rights include the ability to trade what I create for what someone else created. So I have obtained property rights in the house because I created value.

In the case of an employee he creates value, but has agreed to trade the property rights he would have in the thing he created, let’s say part of an automobile, for a pay check (gold, money, etc.). Some people are confused that there is no way the employee could have any property rights in the car he helped build because he did not own any of the parts going into the car. That would be incorrect. The employee would have a partial ownership in the car. It is quite common for many people to have property rights in a single object. For instance, multiple people may own a farm or thousands of people may own a corporation. In the case of the employee he does not want (or the company is not willing) to have a situation with multiple owners, he wants to contract for immediately payment and relinquishes his property rights.

Now that we have a proper understanding of property rights we can determine if something is a real property right. Is a taxi medallion a property right? The question is whether the owner created value for the “rights” obtained with the medallion? The government sold the medallion to the taxi company. However, what did the government do to create the taxi medallion? It limited other people from starting a taxi service. That is not creating value and the money the taxi company paid to the city does not create value. When someone trades a value for a non-value it destroys or at best just transfers the value from a producer to a non-producer. The most common case of this is a swindler who takes value from the victim and provides nothing in return and this is what a thief also does and wealth transfer programs.

A new invention is creating value and therefore a person obtains a property right in their invention. Academics, Libertarian, Socialists, and Austrian Economists have filled the ether with numerous nonsensical arguments against patents. I deal with these in depth in my books [The Decline and Fall of the American Entrepreneur](http://www.amazon.com/Decline-Fall-American-Entrepreneur-Regulations-ebook/dp/B005NJYK1S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404667058&sr=8-1&keywords=dale+b.+halling) and [The Source of Economic Growth](http://www.amazon.com/Source-Economic-Growth-Dale-Halling-ebook/dp/B00XDAG22E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1431378096&sr=8-2&keywords=Dale+B.+Halling) **(Included as Part 2 of this book)**.

A property right can never be a monopoly. Economists attempt to show patents or other property rights are monopolies based on perfect competition. In fact they base their anti-trust analysis on perfect competition. (I explain this in more detail in Part 2) However, perfect competition is a recipe for the destruction of wealth and therefore human life. Perfect competition is a value laden concept whose value is not the man’s life, but the destruction and sacrifice of mens’ lives and their productive efforts.

Intellectual Capitalism specifically rejects the concept of perfect competition as a valid economic concept or ideal and also as being useful to analyze any real life economic situations. As a result, Intellectual Capitalism rejects the whole anti-trust and rent seeking analysis based on perfect competition, and as a result rejects all anti-trust laws (as formulated in the United States, but not the original Statute of Monopolies) as wealth destroying economic policies.

A monopoly is an abrogation of proper property rights and is created by government decrees that impinge of proper property rights. When the government does this and creates laws that give a single company (person) the right to a market say for salt or telephone services then it creates a monopoly. When the government’s laws limits access to a market by impinging on valid property rights then the company or companies (people) who are the beneficiaries are rent seeking. The proper response when one of these situations is found is to restore people’s valid property rights. The analysis of monopolies or rent seeking starts with and ends with an analysis of property rights. As should be apparent Intellectual Capitalism rejects the whole idea of natural monopolies, which are abrogation’s of peoples’ property rights.

Supply and Demand and Spontaneous Order

Supply and demand is one of the most fundamental concepts/tools in economics. The price of an item is set where the supply curve and the demand curve overlap. Note that these curves are conceptual not quantitative. The whole analysis is based on the idea that markets will drive towards this equilibrium point. Unfortunately, this whole analysis is based on a technologically stagnant economy. In addition, it can give the incorrect impression that demand or consumption is just as important in economics as production.

The requirement of supply and demand that the economy be technologically stagnant means that supply and demand curves only applies in the most unimportant part of the economy. Supply and demand curves do not tell us how wealth is created or how to create wealth. Some people see supply and demand plus the pricing information as ordering the economy. This in fact is Hayek’s spontaneous order argument. Again this is only true of a technologically stagnant market (and one with essentially free trade). However, prices plus supply and demand rules do not tell people what to invent. It is true that people, who live in a country with property rights for inventions, tend to invent in the largest markets, however there is no way to create or even postulate a supply and demand curve for such a situation. Most experts saw no need for a device that transmitted voice. What the experts (people with the money) wanted was a way to send telegraph signals faster or more of them over the same wire. So the demand was essentially nil for an invention that transmited voice signals before it was invented and for sometime thereafter. No price could have been determined for an invention that could send voice signals. Hayek’s spontaneous order did not direct the economy to invent telephones or any other major inventions. Hayek’s spontaneous order is interesting, but hardly earth shattering and limited to the most uninteresting, low value areas of the economy.

Supply and demand curves are useful as long as there limitations are properly recognized. As a result, they are part of Intellectual Capitalism, but only of minor import.

  
  

## Economics and Evolution: How We Think and Grow Rich

  
  

I was visiting the Neanderthal Museum in Mettmann, Germany, when I was confronted by a display of a homo sapien sapiens, or a modern man. The display explained that homo sapien sapiens have a brain that is only 2% of their mass, but consumes 20-25% of all the calories they take in. That makes modern man an incredibly risky evolutionary experiment, one that almost failed.**[1]** Those calories and that brain do not provide any immediate evolutionary advantage, they do not allow humans to run faster, or give them stronger jaws to tear flesh, or a hard shell to protect them from predators. However, the ability to reason allows humans to create all these things and more.

It turns out for all those dieters out there that it does not matter whether we think hard with our brains or just leave them in idle. This means the brain has very high fixed costs, but very low marginal costs. It seems like something that a venture capitalist might invest in. This reminded me of the following connection between economics and evolution:

If humans did not invent, then the study of economics would just be the study of human evolution.

Now this might strike you as odd, however if I can convince you it is true or even plausible, you would have to admit that it would have profound consequences. Some of the most important discoveries are those that connect two areas of knowledge that were thought to be separate, such as electricity and magnetism, or geometry and algebra, or physics and chemistry.

Plants and animals adapt to their environment, while humans adapt their environment to them. In evolution when a plant or animal mutates (changes) so that it is better adapted to the environment, then their population increases (as does their range) until they again reach an ‘equilibrium’ between their food supply or resources and the size of their population. This idea was first proposed by Thomas Malthus with respect to man and Charles Darwin was the one that applied it to evolution.

Once the organism has reached this equilibrium, it either has to change again, or some other organism does so. Less successful organisms go extinct or evolve into other more successful life forms. Evolution is a process for producing those life forms that are best adapted at converting energy into life.

Most free market people have rejected Malthus’ ideas in the realm of economics, however it is important to point out that Malthus was correct for all of human history until the Industrial Revolution. Humans do not evolve biologically to become more successful, instead they create things, i.e., they invent.**[2]** In many ways a man with a spear or bow and arrow is not the same thing from an evolutionary point of view as a man whose only technology is a stone hand axe, who is not the same organism from an evolutionary point of view as a man whose technology includes agriculture. Our inventions allow us to create a great diversity of beings that can survive in dry hot deserts, wet tropical forests, and frigid arctic conditions. We can do this despite the fact that homo sapien sapiens are genetically very non-diverse. The point I am making is that:

Inventions are the equivalent of genetic changes from an evolutionary point of view.

Like other organisms when we changed to become more successful at converting energy into life our population grew. For instance, when man invented agriculture, the population of humans increased exponentially as did the territory over which man spread. This is exactly what would happen with a species that had a positive genetic change.

The sad point is that the humans who were part of the initial agricultural revolution were probably somewhat wealthier than previous generations, however that wealth went into increasing the population until the average person was no wealthier than before the agricultural revolution. This is known as the Malthusian Trap and it is where the average person’s (organism) income is just sufficient to keep them from starving to death or what people call a subsistence income.

This is a depressing perspective. How did humans ever escape the Malthusian Trap? Extrapolating from what we have learned, it is clear that humans had to increase their technology (new inventions) faster than their population grew. In other words, we had to do more thinking (inventing) and less procreating. Modern economic research has confirmed this. Robert Solow won the Nobel Prize in Economics for a paper that showed exactly this. He studied the sources of economic growth in the U.S. economy and found that it was not increases in land, labor, or capital, but increases in the level of technology that increased real per capita incomes.

This has the following implications for economics:

1. The per capita wealth of a technologically stagnant people will be stagnant or declining.

2 The only way to increase real per capita incomes sustainably is to increase our level of technology.

3. The only way to increase our level technology in the long run is to create new inventions.

The first statement has a perfect analogue in evolution, if you replace technology with genetic changes and per capita wealth with increasing population: a species that does not evolve will have a stagnant or declining population. The reason I suggest that that income (population) will fall is because of ‘entropy.’**[3]** In the second part of this boo, **Source of Economic Growth**, I make an analogy between entropy and the classical economics idea of diminishing returns, however that is beyond the scope of this article.

This area of economics is called bioeconomics or thermoeconomics. Most of the economics profession has ignored this area of study, probably because it usually devolves into successive proofs that we are doomed by the Malthusian Trap. Despite this I think there is much to be learned in this area. For instance, Edwin Schrodinger’s failed attempt to tie life to entropy is eye opening. An interesting economist in this area is Gregory Clark, who wrote Farewell to Alms. I do not agree with all his conclusions, but he asks the right questions,**[4]** which is more important than having the right answers to the wrong questions. Clark’s analysis of the results of economic policies in an economy stuck in the Malthusian Trap is unassailable.

Economies today are hamstrung by absurd regulations and there would be an immense, but one-off benefit in freeing up the economy. Then the question arises—once completely free, how does this economy continue to grow? Statement (2) follows from (1) and has an analogy in evolution: The only way for a species to increase its population (in the long run) is for it to evolve (change, mutate). Most economists want to place their emphasis on manufacturing and trade. Manufacturing and trade are about the dissemination of new technologies (or replacement of worn out equipment) they are more similar to increasing the population of a species and spreading out its territory once the species has had a successful mutation.

People can only increase their level of technology by creating new inventions, which means they can only become wealthier by inventing faster than their population increases. Now this is a confusing statement, because population can be counted easily, but what does it mean to say that inventions or technology are increasing and how does that compare to the population. We know that the increases in productivity due to the new technologies must be greater on a percentage level than the increases in the population for per capita incomes to grow. One of the interesting self-correcting outcomes of this proposition is that the more people there are, the more likely someone will come up with a new invention. This means that a declining population or even a stagnant population is not the driver of real per capita increases in wealth. Indeed, declining populations often also lead to a problem in the demographic pyramid—the ratio of the very old and infirm to the productive.

The key question in economics is how do we encourage people to create these positive mutations (inventions)? In the history of the world, the rate at which new inventions were created was roughly proportional to the size of the population and somewhat to population density until the Industrial Revolution. It is also clear that inhibiting peoples’ right to act freely will inhibit the creation of new technologies. It was not until around 1800 that England, and then, the United States, created an explosion in the rate of new inventions on a scale the world had never seen. This resulted in large numbers of people escaping the Malthusian Trap for the first time in history. What these countries had in common is that they created effective property rights for inventors for large numbers of people for the first time in history.

Inventing for humans is analogous to genetic adaptations in other organisms. Originally, human inventions resulted in population increases, just like successful adaptations in other species resulted in population and territory increases for them. A technologically stagnant human civilization is like a genetically static species and in both cases their population (or income) will be flat or declining.**[5]** The study of economics is about how we create, produce, and distribute these inventions (genetic adaptions). If humans did not invent then the only way for us to become more successful would be genetic adaptation, which would mean that the study of economics would be the same thing as the study of human evolution.

  
  

  
  

**[1** Other animals have brains with a similar or greater brain to body mass ratio, but humans consume the most energy as a percentage of total calories on maintaining their brains.

**[2** The term invention is poorly defined in common usage and in economics and law. An invention is a human creation that has an objective result. A human creation that has a subjective result is art.

**[3]** The word entropy here is analogous to that used in physics and chemistry, but not exactly the same. In fact, the way entropy is defined in these areas is not perfectly consistent, but that is the subject of another article.

**[4]** The two most important questions in economics are: 1) What is the cause of increasing real per capita income?, and 2) What was the cause of the industrial revolution (the first time people escaped the Malthusian Trap)? I believe I got both of these questions from Professor Clark.

**[5]** It is hard to find great examples of this in human history but three are the Vikings on Greenland, the Anasazi around Chaco Canyon, and the European dark ages.

  
  

  
  

## Economics, Evolution, and Rand’s Meta-Ethics (Intellectual Capitalism: Fundamentals Part 2)

(This chapter is very similar to the previous chapter from another perspective)

The most important question in economics is: What is the source of real per capita increases in wealth? In my talk at Atlas Summit 2015, I examined how many prominent economists throughout history have answered this question. I finished this survey with the latest research in this area which is known as “New Growth Economics.” I explained where I thought these economists had gone off track and where they were inconsistent with Ayn Rand’s ideas. I concluded with an outline of a science of economics that I think is consistent with Objectivism, natural rights, and the founding principles of the United States.

In this talk I am going to investigate this question from a bioeconomics point of view. Bioeconomics or thermoeconomics (aka biophysical economics) attempts to tie economics to biology and thermodynamics. In other words its goal is to provide a physical as opposed to a sociological basis for economics. This area of study has been around since the 1920s and has never been accepted as part of mainstream economics for good reason. In most cases the research in this area has been an endless way of restating or proving the ideas of Thomas Malthus, a favorite of the environmentalist movement. The famous physicists Edwin Schrodinger, of the Schrodinger wave equation in quantum mechanics, waded into this area and developed some interesting ideas about life and entropy. However, it turned out that a number of his ideas were based on an unsound position about entropy or the second law of thermodynamics.

Despite this I think there is some useful information to be gleaned from this work and the goal of providing a physical basis for economics. Most of the economics profession disagrees, however there was a lady from Russia who thought that ethics was based in reality, specifically the biological reality of man and what is necessary to sustain his life, despite the scorn of most philosophers. Rand showed that ethics was not arbitrary whim, but derived from the nature of man.

I am going to do something unusual, I am going to state some of the most important claims of this talk upfront.

1. If man did not invent, then the study of economics would be the same as the study of human evolution.

2 Inventions are the equivalent of genetic changes from an evolutionary point of view.

3. Rand’s metaethics and biological evolution are aligned.

I bet that you think that some of these claims are bit far out. However, I think you will have to admit that if I can show that these are true then they have profound consequences.

Rand’s analysis of ethics starts with the understanding that man is a living organism and he has some things in common with all living organisms and some things that differ.

“An organism’s life depends on two factors: the material or fuel which it needs from the outside, from its physical background, and the action of its own body, the action of using that fuel properly. What standard determines what is proper in this context? The standard is the organism’s life, or: that which is required for the organism’s survival.”

The Virtue of Selfishness, “The Objectivist Ethics.”

  
  

“If an organism fails in the basic functions required by its nature … [it] dies.”

The Virtue of Selfishness, “The Objectivist Ethics.”

Rand’s ability to build an ethics on biological reality is a profound accomplishment and a big reason why Objectivism became so important to me. Ethics is about what we should do. It’s a code of action. Economics as I define it is about how we accomplish this: that is how we survive. As Rand points out for most organisms their code of actions is hardwired in their genetics. “How” to accomplish these goals is also hardwired.

“A plant has no choice of action: the goals it pursues are automatic … determined by its nature.”

The Virtue of Selfishness, “The Objectivist Ethics.”

This is what I mean by metaethics, it is the ethics of non-volitional beings.

Rand’s metaethics is aligned with the fundamentals of biological evolution. Evolution is built on two or three very simple observations: 1) a selection mechanism, commonly called natural selection, and 2) a change mechanism, which includes sexual reproduction and asexual genetic changes. Rand’s point that if an organism fails it dies is another way of stating that there is a selection mechanism. The idea of a selection mechanism is an inevitable result of the nature of life and its fundamental alternative, death. The “goal” of life is not competition (selection of the fittest) despite the natural selection component of evolution. By “goal” I mean the natural direction the process will take. In the case of life and evolution, the goal is to maximize the amount of energy converted into life.

What determines if an organism or a species survives is its automatic code or DNA that determines both what it should do and how it should do it.**[1]** For instance a plant values water and it grows roots into the soil to obtain water. Both the value and how to achieve the value are “hardwired” by its DNA. This shows that Rand’s metaethics hints at the idea of a genetic code that is changeable biologically.

The unique nature of man is that he is a rational animal according to Rand and Aristotle.**[2]** This means that man does not have an automatic code of values or automatic knowledge, in other words he does not have an instinct. This provides the advantage of being able to obtain new knowledge and react to different situations in unique ways but it also means that we have to define our own code of values and acquire knowledge.

Biology provides support for Rand and Aristotle. Human (homo sapiens sapiens) brains use 25% of the bodies total caloric intake, despite the fact that they are only 2% of the total weight. This is significantly more than other animals. Mammals’ brains only use 2%-10% of their total caloric intake.**[3]** Those calories and that brain do not provide any immediate evolutionary advantage, they do not allow humans to run faster, or give them stronger jaws to tear flesh, or a hard shell to protect them from predators. However, the ability to reason allows humans to create all these things and more.

It turns out for all those dieters out there that it does not matter whether we think hard with our brains or just leave them in idle. This means the brain has very high fixed costs, but very low marginal costs. It seems like something that a venture capitalist might invest in.

All organisms have a certain minimum number of calories they need to obtain to stay alive. This resting rate of burning calories we can consider to be entropy. Entropy was originally a concept from thermodynamics. One dictionary definition of entropy is that it is a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work. Here we are just using entropy to denote that every living being consumes energy that is not available for the organism to do useful work. We could just say that life requires energy without probably any loss of meaning. Failure to overcome this entropy results in the death of that organism. Life requires a profit meaning we have to produce more than the amount of energy than we consume. A loss is when we spend more energy than we have obtained. This provides us a biological definition of profit and loss and shows that consistent losses result in biological death, just like consistent financial losses result in the financial death of an organization.

On a species level (except humans), life attempts to overcome entropy by adaptations that make it more successful at acquiring useful energy. The more successful the species is at acquiring useful energy, the greater its population (and territory) will become, which will increase its chances of having offspring and useful adaptations. However, it will mean that the individuals in the species will also eventually begin to compete with each other for the resources that provide the energy to overcome the entropy. Because of population increases and using up the available energy, the species will be back at the point at which the calories it acquires are just on the edge of starvation, otherwise known as the Malthusian trap. Then, another adaptation of that species or another species will result in excess free energy, an increase in the population of that adapted species, and the process will repeat.

Humans have a low genetic diversity especially for a species with our population and geographic territory.**[4]** This would appear to be inconsistent with biological evolution, however it is important to remember that humans adapt the environment to their needs, while other organism adapt to the environment. The way humans adapt the environment is by creating things to solve problems and these are called inventions. An invention is a unique combination of elements that solves an objective problem. Thus the invention of how to make (preserve) fire solves the objective problems of cooking and providing warmth. Humans do not wait for genetic changes they create inventions that allow them to change their environment. This means that inventions function like genetic changes for humans. Our inventions allow us to create a great diversity of beings that can survive in dry hot deserts, wet tropical forests, and frigid arctic conditions. A human with a club and fur skin is a different species (organism) from a non-biological evolution point of view than a man with a high power rifle and wearing synthetic fibers who raises cows, chickens, and grows wheat.

When humans created a new invention our population increased and many times our territory also increased. The two biggest historical examples are the Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. After the Agricultural Revolution the population and geographical territory of humans expanded rapidly. The Agricultural Revolution was really a group of inventions. Unfortunately, the Agricultural Revolution did not result in humans escaping the Malthusian Trap (living on the edge of starvation). This was because the surplus energy provided by agriculture was taken up by the increase in human population, which is the same thing that happens to organisms with successful genetic mutations.

How did we escape the Malthusian Trap then? We had to create inventions at a rate that gave us a profit that exceeded the rate at which human population expanded. This happened during the Industrial Revolution for the first time in history. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution the percentage of people escaping the Malthusian Trap has continued to increase despite an explosion in our population. Something happened at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution that had never occurred in human history: we started inventing at an unprecedented rate. The question is why that occurred? Before the Industrial Revolution, around 1800, inventions occurred roughly at a rate that was proportional to our population, however this is not what happened in the Industrial Revolution. The explosion of inventions was fairly isolated to a small population in a relatively small geographic area, specifically the people of Great Britain and the United States. The reason this occurred is that this was the first time in human history that large groups of people had access to property rights in their inventions (i.e., patents).

An interesting question is whether other organisms could evolve biologically fast enough to escape the Malthusian Trap? The answer is no, because organisms modify themselves (adapt to the environment) and to escape Malthusian Trap it is necessary to modify the environment. An organism that was highly effective at modifying itself would just become so successful that it would destroy its inputs (consume all its resources).

Would it be possible, as some environmentalists suggest, that once we escaped the Malthusian Trap we could just stop inventing and stay at our present level of wealth? No, because of entropy or diminishing returns. The classical economists argued that diminishing returns were due to the lower quality of inputs overtime. For instance, once it was found that coal was useful the initial coal could be picked up off the ground and used relatively near where it was found. Over time people had to start mining the coal and transporting it over longer distances. As they dug into the ground, water would collect in their mines and that had to be removed. The easy to mine coal was used up first. This problem is related to the randomness conception of “entropy.”**[5]** The coal is not uniformly spread throughout the world.

The result is that our output (wealth) will decline over time if we do not continue to invent. The second law of thermodynamics says that we cannot create a perpetual motion machine. When environmentalists offer the solution of sustainability they are attempting to build a perpetual motion machine.

Sustainability is not Sustainable

They are trying to create a system in which the quality of the inputs never decreases. The environmentalists are correct that we create waste (low value outputs) and we will not be able to forever use the same processes without running into problems. However the solution is not to stop inventing and freeze our technology, but to continue to create new technologies at a rapid rate. This has the following implications for economics:

1. The per capita wealth of a technologically stagnant people will be stagnant or declining.

2 The only way to increase real per capita incomes sustainably is to increase our level of technology.

3. The only way to increase our level technology in the long run is to create new inventions.

The first statement has a perfect analogue in evolution, if you replace technology with genetic changes and per capita wealth with increasing population: a species that does not evolve will have a stagnant or declining population. The best human example of this that I know of is the Dark Ages. The level of European technology declined. For instance, the process of creating concrete was lost. The Romans had a mechanical reaper for corn, which was lost until Cyrus McCormick invented a new (commercially practical) reaper in 1837, and numerous construction techniques, such as those used to build the Pantheon were also lost. As a result Europe’s population decreased and so did its population density. Another, example is Easter Island around 1600, where the islanders cut down all the trees and lost the top soil to farm and without the tall trees they were no longer able to fish. Because the Easter Island Polynesians were technologically stagnant their inputs declined until they could no longer support their population. It is estimated that their population fell from a peak of 15,000 to 10,000 down around 2,000. Farmland is another example where the output declines overtime without new technologies.

This leads to the question of whether inventions are subject to diminishing returns. I discuss this is great detail in Part 2. Here I will just cover some of the most basic points. An invention is a unique combination of elements (things, components) that provide an objective result. Every invention can be a component (element) of another invention. As a result, every invention opens up a number of potential inventions. The number of potential inventions expands combinatorially as new inventions are created.

However, this is just potential inventions. Studies have shown that narrow areas of technology often appear to be subject to diminishing returns over time. Meaning the next invention is more expensive or provides less performance gain or both. For instance, vacuum tubes were limited in their switching speed and how small they could be made. The cost and performance of military jets is another example. There was a chart created by an undersecretary of the Army, Norman Augustine, showing that in the not too distant future a single jet fighter would cost the entire GDP of the U.S. The physical speed of vehicles also seems to have peaked.

Generally, these technology bottlenecks have been solved by cross over technologies. For instance, vacuum tubes were replaced with discrete transistors, which were replaced by integrated circuits. Ray Kurzweil, futurist and prolific inventor, has shown that despite the limitations of individual areas of technology, computing power has been growing at a relatively uniform rate since Babbage created the mechanical computer around 1822.

The cost performance limitations of jet fighters have been overcome by electronics and UAVs. Electronics have allowed old airframes to be upgraded significantly in performance, without the cost of building better or even new airframes.

There is no macro evidence that inventions are subject to diminishing returns.

Conclusion

I have approached the question of “What is the source of real per capita increases in wealth?” from both a New Growth (see Part 2) and Bioeconomics point of view and they both provide the same answer, inventions. This is consistent with Rand who points out that man’s mind is the ultimate source of all human wealth. Inventions are just the application of man’s mind to the objective problems of life.

Inventions are the evolutionary equivalent of genetic changes. Manufacturing (reproduction) and distribution are the evolutionary equivalent of reproduction and territory expansion of new biological organisms.

Profit and loss have a real physical meaning. They are not just an arbitrary way of keeping score in a parlor game as both the left and to some extend the economics profession treats them. Those people who advocate making profits illegal are advocating death, literally.

Sustainability is not Sustainable because of entropy. However, if peoples’ natural rights are protected and their rights to their inventions are secured, then technology can grow much faster than entropy.

This research shows that Rand’s criticisms of economics were spot on and the whole of economics needs to be rethought in light of these insights.

**[5]** My investigation of this issue has shown me that out present conception of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics has some inconsistencies. The easiest problem to understand with entropy (2nd law) is that it only applies to an isolated system. However an isolated system is one that in which there is no gravity. Such a system does not exists.

  
  

## Money and Banking (Intellectual Capitalism Part 3)

  
  

There are a lot of misconceptions about money and banking. Often people either think these are the root of all our problems or the solution to all our problems. Both seem to believe that once money enters the equation in economics magic happens. This paper will focus on how money and banking work in a free market and then examine the distortions caused by government manipulation of money and banking.

Money

If you examine an economics book on money it will tell you money is a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Some economist say that money being a medium of exchange is the real function (definition) and the other two functions follow from money’s primary purpose. I agree and therefore in this paper the definition of money is a medium of exchange.

All sorts of things have served as money including sea shells, tobacco leaves, grain, large immovable stones, tea leaves, cigarettes, silver, gold, paper, and computer bits (entries). Why money is a useful invention is usually explained by way of an example. Suppose that you raise cows for a living and you wanted to buy a loaf of bread. If you tried to trade your cow to the butcher, you would want several hundred loaves of bread in return. Most of the bread would spoil before you can eat it, so you only want two loaves of bread now. On top of this, the baker wants chickens not a cow. Under a bartering system these transaction will not occur, however with the addition of money you can sell your cow to the butcher and he will give you money. You can then use the money to buy two loaves of bread, which the baker can use to buy chickens.

It is likely that money originally grew out of an IOU (I Owe yoU) system. For instance, in the example above it is possible that once the rancher and the baker agree that the cow is worth 300 loaves of bread, then the baker would give the rancher two loaves of bread and an IOU for 298 loaves of bread. The rancher intends to present the IOU to the baker every week for his two loaves of bread. At which time the baker will give him two loaves of bread and an amended (new) IOU.

Unfortunately, the rancher gets sick and needs a doctor. The doctor agrees to accept the baker’s IOU in payment for his services. Now the baker’s IOU has acted as medium of exchange, which means it is money.

Money is just a generally accept IOU. In other words many people will accept it as a general IOU that they can “redeem” from most people. In the example above the doctor would have to worry that the baker might not make good on his IOU. Now some people will argue that only paper fiat money is a generalized IOU. However, even gold is functioning as a generalized IOU. It is commodity money and as a result may have value in the market separate from its use as an IOU, but the person accepting it as money does not need it as a commodity. He is planning on trading it with other people for goods and services. On a deserted island (with no hope of rescue) you could have a ton of gold, but it would useless and you would not be better off with it than without it. This also shows that wealth is not the same thing as having money.

One of the advantages of this point of view on money as an IOU is that it makes it clear that money is not wealth, even gold. The Spanish Kings and Queens found out this point when they brought back tons, literally, of gold and silver but still ended up going bankrupt. The gold was not wealth and they spent their gold on things that did not create wealth. Wealth is the things and knowledge that solve the objective problems of life (inventions). I added the knowledge part because if you give an aboriginal person living in the Brazilian rain forest a super-computer, or an MRI machine, or even a bulldozer they are not wealthier because they do not know how to use these things (inventions) or even trade them. Wealth is also about the objective problems of life, the most fundamental ones being air, water, and food. These are still problems for many people in the third world. Even in wealthy first world countries people have real objective problems, such as health problems, safety, etc. It might not be as obvious why cruise control or smart phones solve objective problems, however if you think about it both do.

The idea that money is not wealth is important because it immediately makes the fallacy of Mercantilism apparent, which Adam Smith spent 100s of pages on. In addition, it makes it clear that we cannot become wealthier by manipulating the money supply. The only way to become wealthier on a per capita basis is to create new things that are more efficient at solving the objective problems of life or solve new objective problems of life, in other words create new inventions.

People often argue about the differences between money, currency, real money, commodity money, debt money, paper money, and fiat money. Currency is generally defined as something that is specifically designed to function as money, such as coins. Commodity money is when the money is a commodity such as silver, gold, grain, or is backed by a commodity. Now real money can mean several different things, however I am talking about people who argue that only gold (silver) is real money. By this they seem to mean that gold is a commodity money and all other currencies are to be measured against gold. All commodity moneys have the advantage that they are more difficult for the government to devalue, however bitcoin also has this feature. The other point is that gold has a long tradition as a widely recognized money. This is true but does nothing to enlighten what money is or what its function is.

Fiat money is money that is not backed by a commodity. Usually it is paper money although more and more it is just electronic entries in a computer and often it is legal tender, which will discuss in more detail shortly. Paper money is self-explanatory. Debt money can have several meanings, but usually means the money “created” when a person (entity) takes out a loan. Many people argue that debt money is evil or somehow costs us interest just to have money. Since all money is essentially an IOU, all money is created by a debt, i.e., a claim to future goods and services.

Proto Banking

Banking and money have been closely linked at least since the Agricultural Revolution about 11,000 year ago. The Agricultural Revolution was a series of inventions that provided man with access to a huge increase in the number of calories per acre. As a result, the human population expanded enormously and the territory of humans also expanded. These excess calories were converted into population increases until the number of calories collected/created by the human population were roughly equivalent to the number necessary to support that population.

The grains that were the major source of these extra calories had to be stored, because the grains ripened all at once. While the grain was stored, it needed to be protected from water and vermin. If the grain ran out before the next harvest, people starved to death. Efficient, effective storage of grains reduced the chances of running out grain before the next harvest. A centralized grain storage (grain silos) was more effective than individual storage of grains. When a farmer deposited their grain they received a receipt (clay tablet) for the grain. Eventually people started to use these receipts to pay for other goods (services). For instance, if you wanted to buy a chicken instead of going to the grain silo and taking out enough grain to pay for the chicken, you just handed over some of these clay tablets to the owner of the chicken. In other words these receipts became money.

In ancient Mesopotamia, as long ago as 5000 B.C.E., clay tablets were used to represent beer or grain.**[1]** These clay tablets functioned as money. Gold also started functioning as money about the same time, but was probably only used for large or long distance payments and therefore was not used by average people.**[2]** These clay tablets were “created out of thin air” in the vernacular of today. After a harvest there would be a lot of these clay tablets around and we would say the money supply increased. As people withdrew grain, the grain bank would redeem these receipts. We do not know if the “bank” destroyed these clay tablets, which would have been the logical thing to do or if they stored them for the next harvest. Either way the money supply would shrink until the next harvest. In fact the number of clay tablets (in circulation) would have shrunk to almost to zero just before the next harvest. We know this is the case because of evolution. Population expands until it takes up the available food supply, which is known as the Malthusian Trap. This means the grain would be almost gone by the time the next harvest rolled around.

If you eliminate money (clay tablets) this does not change the economic situation. Until the Industrial Revolution people lived on the edge of starvation and it was common for families to have to ration their food and even pick who would get food and who would not. Because the healthy adults were the only way any of them would survive through the next year, the old, the young, and the sick were the first ones’ whose food was cut off. This is a grim reminder that economics is not just a game, but has real world consequences.

If we replaced the clay tablets with coins (e.g., silver, gold), then the money supply would not go up and down. However, the price of food (and other goods) would go up and down. After a harvest the price of food would be cheap and just before the harvest food would be very expensive. The monetary system would not change the underlying economic situation one bit.

This is what we have learned about money in a free market:

1) Money is a medium of exchange

2) Money is a generalized IOU

3) The money supply can vary in a free market without fractional reserve banking.

4) Many things can function as money and only the market should “decide” what is money.

5) Money is not magic and does not allow magic in economics.

Now we are going to introduce some government (non-free market) distortions to money. Going back to our clay tablets, someone probably realized that it did not make sense to destroy the clay tablets when people withdrew grain, since they would have to make new clay tablets after the harvest. The “bank” probably started storing them and this of course led to the temptation of stealing the clay tablets. Also the government probably decreed that taxes had to be paid in these clay tablets, which was the first step to making them legal tender.

We are going to skip forward to Roman times. The Roman’s used silver coins as their currency. The main unit of money was the denarius, which was between the size of a modern nickel and dime and equivalent to a day’s worth of wages for a skilled laborer.**[3]** As late as 68 C.E. the silver in a denarius was almost 100%, but then it started to decline. People balked at using this debased money, however the government declared the new, lower silver coins legal tender. By 265 C.E. the silver content in coins was down to 0.5%. Not surprisingly the Roman Empire suffered huge inflation. The Roman’s minted so many coins that even today you can buy several Roman coins of standard quality for twenty dollars or so.**[4]** For clarity later on I am going to call this “simple inflation”.

An important point here is that legal tender laws are always the first step towards inflation. The only reason for a government to pass a legal tender law is so that they can “print” money. In other words, the government is undertaking an endeavor that would get any private citizen throw in jail. With the end of the Roman Empire legal tender laws and banking died out during the Dark Ages. Coins were mainly used by the rich during this period.

By the 1700s legal tender laws were being seen again in Europe. France experimented with legal tender laws, allowing The Mississippi Company in the 1710s to have control over its legal tender with disastrous results. Supposedly, the French swore off paper money and modern banking for years after this. Some historians have even argued that this backwardness in France’s finance system was part of why they were beaten by the English. This is a fascinating story, but beyond the scope of this article.

The British followed suit in 1833 making banknotes issued by the Bank of England (a private bank at the time) legal tender.**[5]** The United States had no legal tender laws (after the Constitution) until 1862 during the American Civil War. The North printed $450,000,000 under this law to help finance the war. Eventually this law was declared unconstitutional in **Hepburn v. Griswold**, 75 U.S. 603 (1870). The Court reasoned that the Constitution allowed the federal government to coin money, but not the power to make paper legal tender. The government argued that since it had the power to carry out war and the issuance of the legal tender was necessary for carrying on the war, then legal tender laws fell under the “necessary and proper’ clause of the Constitution. The Court rejected this argument and also pointed to the fact that the Constitution prohibited the states from interfering with contracts. The Constitution did not specifically, prohibit the federal government from interfering with private contracts, but it would be against the spirit of the Constitution to allow the federal government to do so. In one of the stranger twists in history, Salmon P. Chase helped push the legal tender legislation through as Lincoln’s Secretary of Treasury, then he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and lead a 5-3 decision to declare the law unconstitutional. Unfortunately, this case was quickly overruled by the Knox v. Lee, 79 U.S. 457 (1871) Supreme Court decision.

Multiple competing bank notes were the norm at that time. According to the Cato Institute, “the government did not entirely monopolize issuance of notes until 1935, but the laws that made the monopoly possible date from the Civil War.”[6] Today the legal tender law in the US is 35 USC § 5103 which states:

United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.

Legal Tender laws are necessary for government counterfeiting**[7]** to be successful. Without legal tender laws, people would quit accepting the money printed by the government. The key point is that legal tenders are necessary to create inflation. Any further investigation of money will require that we first examine how banks work.

Banking

The first banks in Europe after the Dark Ages were goldsmiths. Because goldsmiths were working with valuable materials they needed vaults. Wealthy patrons would often give some of their gold or other valuables to the goldsmith to secure in their vault. The goldsmith would give the patron a receipt for their gold. Overtime, just like the clay tablets for grain, people started to trade the receipts instead of taking out gold and paying with the gold.

Some of the customers also started asking for loans. The goldsmiths wanted to reduce their risk if the customer defaulted on the loan, so they asked for collateral. Originally, they probably asked for jewelry or other things made of silver and gold, since they knew they could liquidate (sell) these items fairly easily. The goldsmiths could have given the customer gold out of their gold reserve (capital) and they probably did initially. Most likely many customers then gave the gold back to the goldsmith and took receipts for the gold. If the goldsmith’s receipts were trusted enough, they could skip this step and just give the customer receipts. If the customer failed to pay the loan back, the jewelry (collateral) became the property of the goldsmith.

Or the goldsmiths could have given the borrower gold on deposit from other customers, which is the way most people think of banking working. In that case then the gold the goldsmith had on hand (deposit) was less than the amount of the receipts outstanding for the gold, which is fractional reserve banking (assuming the goldsmith had no gold capital or the loan(s) were greater than the goldsmith’s gold capital). Fractional reserve banking is defined as:

a banking system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash on hand and are available for withdrawal.**[8]**

Most customers probably deposited the borrowed gold with the goldsmith and took receipts. Again the goldsmiths probably began to skip the step of giving the borrower actual gold (silver) and just gave them receipts for the gold. At this point it might appear that the goldsmith is “creating money out of thin air”, however the receipts in this case are backed by the collateral, jewelry in this example. Actually, all the outstanding receipts are now backed by the gold on hand and the collateral the goldsmith has for loans.

At this point the goldsmith risks all the holders of these receipts asking for their gold and the goldsmith does not have enough gold to fulfill all these demands. However, the goldsmith does have enough capital to fulfill the demands, because the collateral, jewelry and gold on deposit in this example. It is likely that initially most of these loans were “callable”, meaning that the goldsmith could demand the borrower pay them back in full (gold or receipts) at any time. If the borrower paid up, then the goldsmith had no problem paying off the receipts. If the borrower did not pay up, then goldsmith became the owner of the collateral (jewelry) and could sell it to fully back the receipts.**[9]**

Eventually the goldsmiths realized it was not only jewelry (gold and silver items) that had value and could act as collateral. For instance, arable farmland was one of the most valuable assets that people could own for most of history since the Agricultural Revolution. The goldsmith could not put the farmland in his vault, however he could have a legal claim to the land. That claim stated that if the borrower did not pay back the loan, then the goldsmith owned the farmland. Of course it takes longer to liquidate farmland than jewelry and farmland might be more subject to market fluctuations. As a result, the amount the goldsmith would lend against the farmland was lower than for gold and silver items.

At first goldsmiths probably made loans against farmland that someone owned outright. Eventually, they figured out that they could make loans on farmland that was being purchased, as long as there was a big enough down payment (the equivalent of loaning less than the value of collateral). What the goldsmith is doing is securitizing assets other than gold. When the goldsmiths created receipts for gold and silver deposits they were securitizing gold (and silver). “Securitize is a pooled group of financial assets that together create a new security”**[10]** or banknote in this case. This means that goldsmiths receipts (banknotes) are backed by not only gold deposits but the other assets that they hold as collateral.

This is exactly what a company does when it sells bonds (stock). The bond is backed by the assets (collateral) of the company. The bonds are usually very liquid and can be sold or traded in exchange for goods and services, i.e., the bonds are money.

These goldsmiths became fractional reserve banks once they started securitizing assets other than gold. Fractional reserve banking is an important invention and is created (exists) in a free market. A fractional reserve bank is doing something analogous to what engineers have done with the telephone system. The backbone that connects two people together on a phone line does not have the capacity to allow everyone to make a call at the same time. The engineers know that only a certain fraction of people will normally be on their phones at the same time. By designing a system to handle this level of usage plus a margin, the cost of the telephone system is reduced. Of course occasionally, like in the time of an emergency, everyone wants to use their phone at the same time and then you receive a message like ‘all circuits are busy, please try your call again later.’ Another example is the time sharing of resources is done by computers. Before the 1980s this was done by having a number of computer terminals all connected to one large computer that time shared its resource among these terminals. This is still done within your computer when it runs multiple programs. The processing power of the microcontroller is time shared among these programs.

Banks know that only a small number of people will want gold at the same time. Most of the time people will be happy with banknotes or just accounting entries. However, if people lose confidence in the bank, then they will all want to withdraw gold (cash) at the same time. This is called a ‘run on the bank’ and is the same thing as everyone trying to make a telephone call at the same time. Note that this is a cash flow issue and can happen even to a bank that is profitable. Usually, banks that were clearly profitable could borrow gold from other banks to weather the run.

When a fractional reserve bank (hereinafter bank) initiates a loan against an asset, let’s say a farm, the bank creates a security (banknotes or an entry in a ledger) equal to the amount of the loan. In this process it “creates money” equal to the loan. At one time this might have been done by printing a bunch of banknotes, but now it is an electronic entry in the banks accounting system. An article entitled “Money Creation in the Modern Economy” published by the Bank of England explains “whenever a bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money.”**[11]** This article also points out that “money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions — banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and nor do they ‘multiply up’ central bank money to create new loans and deposits.”**[12]** According to the article, “Money in the Modern Economy: an Introduction”, there are three main sources of money in modern economies, currency, bank deposits (loans by commercial banks) and central bank reserves.**[13]** This article also points out that most money in the economy is created by banks initiating loans. **[14]**

Some people call this debt money and argue it is bad for the economy.**[15]** They imply that this system of money creation requires we pay interest to have money. First, it is important to point out that this sort of money creation happens in a free market. Second, the only one paying interest is the person who took out the loan. In a free market there would also be other forms of money, such as gold, silver, bitcoin etc.

When loans are paid back money is destroyed, just like the case of the clay tablets being destroyed (taken out of circulation) when people turned them in for their grain. The bank no longer has access to the collateral (e.g., farmland, jewelry, etc.). As a result, the banknotes (electronic entries) are destroyed. Note that money is also destroyed if the borrower defaults on the loan.

In a free market (for this discussion most importantly means no legal tender laws and no central bank) banks’ ability to ‘create money’ is limited by the value of the assets used as collateral.**[16]** The bank is not creating money, it is securitizing assets and the banks’ ability to “create” money is then limited to the assets that can be securitized.

If the banks create too many loans that cannot be paid back, then they will have to tighten their lending standards. This will result in fewer loans and less money being created. When the economy is growing banks will fund more loans and create more money. However, the amount of money in the economy will be proportional to the assets that can be collateralized in the economy.

As a result, in a free market fractional reserve banks do cause variations in the money supply, but do not cause long term inflation or deflation. Note that the United States had fractional reserve banks from before the revolution and the United States did not have any periods of inflation. The banks were constrained in how much money they could create. Now prices did vary widely sometimes, particularly in times of war. However it is necessary to separate out the fluctuation in prices due to changes in supply and demand from those due to changes in the quantity of money. During a war (crop failure) there is an increase in the demand for goods and services, particularly food. Men are off fighting instead of planting the fields and the war itself often destroys the crops on large tracks of land. This increase in the price of food will mean that farmland that is not threatened by the war will be more valuable. As a result, it is likely banks will be willing to lend more money against these farms. This will result in some increase in the money supply. However, when the war ends the prices of the farm goods will fall and so will the value of the farmland, which will reduce the number of loans outstanding, reducing the amount of money in the economy. Averaged out over time money grows at the same rate as the economy and prices are roughly stable.**[17]**

This is what we have learned about banking in a free market:

1) Fractional reserve banking exist in and are an invention of a free market.

2) Fractional reserve banks do create and destroy money, however the amount of money created is proportional to the assets in an economy.

3) Fractional reserve banks do not cause inflation.

## How Central Banks Create Inflation (Intellectual Capitalism Part 4)

  
  

Central Banks like the Federal Reserve in the United States are different than commercial fractional reserve banks. As explained in the article A Brief History of Central Banks on the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s website,

A central bank is the term used to describe the authority responsible for policies that affect a country’s supply of money and credit. More specifically, a central bank uses its tools of monetary policy—open market operations, discount window lending, changes in reserve requirements—to affect short-term interest rates and the monetary base (currency held by the public plus bank reserves) and to achieve important policy goals.**[1]**

Unfortunately, this definition misses the fact that central banks are monopolies and therefore not part of capitalism (free market).

A central bank, or monetary authority, is a monopolized and often nationalized institution given privileged control over the production and distribution of money and credit. In modern economies, the central bank is responsible for the formulation of monetary policy and the regulation of member banks.**[2]**

According to this definition a central bank has control over “printing” the national currency, which in the modern world can be done by just a computer entry. If you look into the Federal Reserve of the United States you will find that they have control over printing paper money, while the Treasury has control over minting coins. However most currency today is just a computer entry and here the answers get even more obscure. The best answer is that direct money creation is a dance between Congress, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve. Everything becomes convoluted when a central bank is added into the equation and so far we have only discussed direct creation of currency not open market operations, discount window lending, and changes in reserve requirements. I think politicians and central banks, not to mention the largest banks and brokerages, like this obscurity.

In order to make this less obscure I will analyze each “tool” of a central bank separately. In addition, we are going to analyze the direct money creation issue through the lens of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). One reason to look at MMT it is how most central bankers see the world, which is illuminating. It also points out some uncomfortable truths and exposes some Keynesian nonsense. Wikipedia explains MMT as:

Modern Monetary Theory (MMT or Modern Money Theory, also known as Neo-Chartalism) is a macroeconomic theory which describes and analyses modern economies in which the national currency is fiat money, established and created by the government. The key insight of MMT is that “monetarily sovereign government is the monopoly supplier of its currency and can issue currency of any denomination in physical or non-physical forms. As such the government has an unlimited capacity to pay for the things it wishes to purchase and to fulfill promised future payments, and has an unlimited ability to provide funds to the other sectors. Thus, insolvency and bankruptcy of this government is not possible. It can always pay”.**[3]**

This quote is very revealing, especially the idea that “the government has an unlimited capacity to pay for the things it wishes to purchase and to fulfill promised future payments, and has an unlimited ability to provide funds to the other sectors.” In the Money and Banking chapter I pointed out that when money enters the equation in economics, people think magic happens and logic disappears. The MMT people think they can create wealth by manipulating money. The MMT advocates believe money and banking allow for good magic and Austrian Economics argues that money and banking are bad magic (meaning it destroys wealth). 

This is why I wrote my book on **The Source of Economic Growth** (included as the Part 2 of this book), which shows that increases in real per capita wealth are created by applying our reason to the objective problems of life – in other words by inventing and increasing our level of technology. Money is not wealth, as I showed earlier. Money and banking are mainly a lubricant for the economy. Of course real inventions in money and banking do increase our per capita wealth, such as cryptocurrencies might do if the governments (central banks) of the world would get out the way. Cryptocurrencies hold the promise of significantly reducing the cost of transferring money around the world.

Modern Monetary Theory is correct that the government cannot run out of money if it has legal tender laws, but that does not mean that “the government has an unlimited capacity to pay for the things it wishes.” The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States in 2016 was around $17 trillion.**[4]** If the government decides to spend $20 trillion of wealth and continues to spend more than the total output of wealth of the United States, then the Unites States will go bankrupt. The ability to print (create) more money will not matter. Venezuela has a central bank, but it has not saved Venezuela or allowed its government “to pay for the things it wishes.” The expected inflation rate in 2017 for Venezuela is 1,660% according to the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and its GDP fell 15% in 2016. It also did not save the Weimar Republic which had a central bank, and it did not provide the government an unlimited capacity to pay for the things it wishes. The MMT’s answer to the Weimar Republic is that they were forced to repay their war debts in gold. According to MMT governments with a central bank and legal tender can be infinitely wealthy, which is clearly absurd.

The problem with MMT is it confuses money with wealth. This is similar to how Keynesians reverse cause and effect, by arguing wealth is created by spending (consumption). The ideas underlying MMT were proposed by John Law, who created the Mississippi Company in France in the early 1700s and almost bankrupt the whole country.**[5]** It is a fascinating story, but beyond the scope of this article.

According to MMT the government creates money by spending. As this article, [Why a Central Bank Can Never Run Out of Money](https://dailyreckoning.com/central-bank-can-never-run-money/), explains:

The U.S. government spends it currency into existence. This is important, too. The government spends first and then collects taxes. (Logically, this is how it began, or else how would people get the money to pay taxes?) Taxes are what give the dollar value. As Alfred Mitchell-Innes, a diplomat and credit theorist, once put it: “A dollar of money is a dollar, not because of the material of which it is made, but because of the dollar of tax which is imposed to redeem it.”

According to this statement increasing spending causes inflation, while increases in taxes cause deflation. In the United States the Democrats (socialists) always want to increase spending and taxes, which cancel each other out according to MMT. Republicans (conservatives) want to reduce spending and taxes which would also cancel each other out by this theory. This analysis again confuses money with wealth and it ignores debt financing.

Another amazing thing about this statement is that if you or I “spent money into existence” it would be called counterfeiting and would be considered theft. Somehow when the government does this, it is okay and according to MMT stimulates the economy (creates wealth).

The parenthetical comment “else how would people get the money to pay taxes?” is easily refuted by history. People in the United States paid taxes before the United States government had any legal tender. As a result, there was no way for the government to spend money before it collected taxes. Even a cursory review of history provides numerous other examples, including early man in which there was no formal government. In addition, the previous chapter shows that banks create money when they create loans, which any MMT advocate should know.

I cannot make any sense of the final statement that the value of a dollar is created because of the tax necessary to redeem it. This statement could only make sense to a totalitarian. Totalitarians believe that when the government spends money it gives up some of its power and when it taxes and redeems the money it redeems this power.

This article (, [Why a Central Bank Can Never Run Out of Money](https://dailyreckoning.com/central-bank-can-never-run-money/)) explains the mechanism by which money is created as:

The Treasury spends dollars into existence through the central bank. The central bank credits the accounts of banks, and banks credit whoever is getting paid. Taxes reverse the process. Banks then debit accounts, and the central bank debits the banks. The government cannot run out of credits.

Note that no liability is created by the government in this direct money creation and no one is paying interest on this money, just like no one pays interest when money is printed. There is a myth that all money in the United States (most modern countries) is created by a loan and that we have to pay the banks interest on all money created. This is incorrect, the money created by this direct money creation process is not a loan and no one pays interest to have this money.

This process of money creation is only possible because the government has legal tender laws. In the previous chapter, I pointed out that legal tender laws were necessary for the government to counterfeit money. Since a central bank is tasked with controlling the money supply they require legal tender laws. One of the fastest ways to undermine (eliminate) the Federal Reserve is to eliminate legal tender laws.

In theory Congress has to first authorize spending before the money is created. However, in the United States we are not allowed to audit the Federal Reserve. Thus it is possible even likely that the Federal Reserve creates money (direct money creation as opposed to a loan) and no one knows about it. For instance, the Federal Reserve admitted that it could not account for $9 trillion of off-balance sheet transactions.[6] While these may have been loans (we don’t know because we cannot audit the Federal Reserve), it shows how easy it would be for the Federal Reserve (or Treasury) to just credit someone’s bank account without anyone knowing. Of course, I have no evidence of this, because we cannot audit the Fed, but human history would be on my side.

“Simple Inflation” under a Central Bank

**In the previous chapter,** I defined simple inflation as that which occurs because of printing money or debasing the currency. This direct creation of money function is the same as these processes. The amount of direct money created is equal to the total amount of money spent by the government, less the amount of taxes received, and less the amount of money borrowed by the government. When a government resorts to direct money creation to pay for a large part of their operations, it results in rapidly increasing inflation rates. Venezuela is the most blatant example today.

What we have learned:

*Central banks do not arise in a free market (capitalism) they are a distortion of the free market.

*Central banks require legal tender laws in order to fulfill their mission of controlling the money supply.

*The amount the government spends less the amount it taxes and borrows is the amount of money created by the government (government counterfeiting), which results in simple inflation.

*Modern Monetary Theory confuses money with wealth.

*The fastest way to undermine (eliminate) the Federal Reserve is to eliminate legal tender laws.

Discount Window Lending

When most people think about the Federal Reserve (the central bank in United States) they immediately think about interest rates. The Federal Reserve mainly affects interest rates in the United States by the setting of the Federal Funds Rate and by the Discount Rate. The Federal Funds Rate is set by the Federal Reserve and is the interest rate at which banks lend reserve balances to each other. The Discount Rate is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve. Both of these are related to the Federal Reserve’s function as a lender of last resort and are intended to prevent a “run on a bank.”

A run on bank is when a bank does not have enough cash (species) on hand to meet its customers demand. This can occur to a sound bank and just represents a cash flow issue or it can be the result of a legitimate lack of solvency and confidence in the bank. One of the main justifications for creating the Federal Reserve was to reduce the frequency of this occurring. The empirical evidence is a mixed on this issue. The Federal Reserve was created before the Great Depression and there were huge numbers of bank failures then. However, the number of runs on banks and the number of bank failures where depositors lost money have probably decreased in frequency since the Great Depression.

When the Federal Reserve changes the Federal Funds Rate or the Discount Rate, which they usually change at the same time, it affects the interest rates that banks charge. If the Federal Reserve increases either or both of these interest rates it usually causes banks to increase the interest rates they charge customers. Generally the goal of raising interest rates is to reduce the number of loans banks are making and thereby decrease the money supply or slow its growth. The opposite is true when the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. Thus it is normally considered inflationary when interest rates are lowered and deflationary when interest rates are raised. Unfortunately, the empirical evidence is a bit murky on this issue. For instance, interest rates were very low during the Great Depression in the United States and the money supply was shrinking.**[7]** Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz argued that the Federal Reserve failed to fulfill their responsibility of lender of last resort.**[8]**

Since there appears to be some contradiction between the empirical data and the theory let’s examine this issue more closely. When the Federal Reserve increases interest rates above the free market rate the result is that some projects that would have made economic sense to fund with a loan no longer are. As a result fewer loans will be initiated by banks than would have been the case if interest rates were at the free market rate (the free market rate is the interest rate that banks would charge if there was no central bank). This will reduce the money supply. However this is a transient effect. Once the economy has adjusted to the new interest rates loans will be created at this new lower rate. At this point it is likely the money supply will grow (shrink) roughly at the same rate as the economy. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too far above the free market rate it can cause a nationwide liquidity crises, which will destroy some wealth that was or would have been created. The government can destroy wealth, but it cannot create wealth only redistribute it.

If the Federal Reserve sets the interest rate lower than the free market rate but not too low, then more projects that would have not made economic sense to fund with a loan now are. This results in a one-time increase in the money supply and after that the money supply should grow at about the same rate as the economy. As a result, lowering the interest rate below the free market rate, but not too low, will result in a one-time increase in the money supply.

If a central bank lowers the interest rates too low, banks will refuse to initiate loans. How low? Well if the interest rate that banks can charge to commercial customers is the same as they can get on Treasuries, then the banks are not compensated for the risk and expense of initiating a commercial loan. Banks need to be able to charge interest rates to their commercial customers that compensates for the extra risk and expense involve over supposedly safe investments like Treasuries (government bonds). As a result, when interest rates are set too low by the central bank it results in a contraction of the money supply.

This shows that low interest rates (lower than free market rates) are not the cause of long term inflation and if the interest rate is too low it can be deflationary. This is likely what has been happening in Japan since the 1990s and happened in United States during the Great Depression. Other government policies can also effect how the economy behaves, which makes it hard to nail down the exact effect of the central banks policies. For instance, Friedman and Schwartz seemed to blame the Federal Reserve for everything that happened in the Great Depression, however it is clear that other anti-free market policies by Roosevelt and Hoover before him also contributed significantly to the Great Depression.

Central banks can also change the number of loans that are initiated by changing the reserve ratio requirement.

The commercial bank’s reserves normally consist of cash owned by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (vault cash), plus the amount of the commercial bank’s balance in that bank’s account with the central bank.**[9]**

However, this also should have a one-time effect on the money supply. The result is that long term inflation is not caused by a central bank’s interest rate policy. A central bank’s failure to act as a lender of last resort may cause an extended period of deflation however.

Open Market Operations

Another tool of central banks is open market operations where the bank goes into the market and sells or buys securities, usually bonds. When a central bank buys securities it increases the money supply. This operation involves the central bank creating money (a computer entry without any associated liability) and then buying the securities, which puts money into the economy. As those bonds (normally the central bank buys bonds) are paid off it decreases the money supply. As a result, buying securities results in a one-time increase in inflation that is removed as the bond is paid back. Of course the central bank can continue to buy bonds if it wants to continue to inflate.

Alternatively, the central bank can sell securities, which results in a decrease in the money supply as private parties trade cash for the security. As the private parties receive payments from the securities (if they are bonds) the money is reintroduced into the economy. Each purchase by the central bank is a one-time decrease in the money supply (assuming the security is a bond) that is removed over time as the bond is paid back.

Both of the scenarios above assume that the central bank is buying or selling bonds (or other securities) at their free market rate. If the central bank over pays for a bond the amount that it overpays for the bond is a direct creation of money and is not redeemed as the bond is paid off.

When the bond is a government bond (national) and the central bank agrees to purchase the bond at a lower interest rate than the free market rate, this results in the direct creation of money equal to the difference in the required payments in a free market verses what the government actually pays. This is clearly inflationary and very subtle.

When a central bank starts buying a significant percentage of the government bonds when issued, the most likely reason is that private buyers are not willing to purchase the bonds at the price (interest rate) the government wants to sell them at. This is one of the surest signs that the central bank is creating large amounts of money to finance the government. However, it is very subtle. It is very hard to calculate how much money has been directly created. If the central bank buys the government bonds near their real cost and requires payments based on tax receipts, then the amount of inflation is very small or not at all. Alternatively, the central bank can just quietly retire these bonds and then the inflation is huge. In the United States we cannot audit the Federal Reserve, so we have very little idea of what is really happening. Inflation caused by open market operations and interest rate targeting are subtle and hard to detect and I call the inflation caused by these operations “complex inflation.” Central banks and the legal tender laws they depend on are designed to obscure what the government and central bank are doing. This allows for all sorts of mischief and inside deals. Attempts to measure money creation, M0-M4, do not differentiate between these mechanisms and therefore are poor at predicting inflation.

How many companies did the Federal Reserve bail out in 2008? Did these companies really pay back their loans? We know for sure that banks were allowed to “borrow” huge sums money from the Federal Reserve at near zero interest rates and then “invest” this money in Treasuries. This was just a complex way of hiding the fact that the Federal Reserve created (printed) money and gave it to these banks. The procedure was obscure enough that most Americans would either not understand what was happening or would get bored when someone explained it to them. However, the money created was paid for by (really stolen from) all those Americans (and people forced to use US dollars around the world) who hold or work for US dollars. The bankers then paid themselves huge bonuses for their brilliant investment strategies.

Here is what we have learned:

Central banks create money directly, although in theory in the United States with the direction of Congress and the Treasury.  
When central banks change the interest rates it causes a one-time increase in inflation (deflation). Low interest rates do not cause long term inflation

Open market operations provide numerous ways to increase inflation that are subtle and hard to detect. 

  
  

  
  

History of Central Banks in the United States

Many people label the First National Bank of the United States as a central bank. A central bank is different from a national bank, such as the First National Bank (FNB) of the United States setup during Washington’s presidency. The FNB was a private bank in which the federal government had a twenty percent equity interest. It was forbidden from buying government bonds, had a mandatory rotation of directors, it could not issue notes or incur debt beyond its capitalization, and the federal government could withdraw its money from the FNB and place it with another bank.**[10]** The FNB of the United States was a truly a private bank, not a central bank. It did not set the policies that “affect a county’s supply of money and credit.” It also did not issue legal tender.

Hamilton and Washington pushed for a national bank because the national government had to be able to pay bills through-out the nation and a national bank made this easier than working with multiple different banks. Depending on a person’s view of central banking they either vilify Hamilton or think he was a genius. Both sides seem to confuse the national bank issue with the Hamilton’s efforts to put the newly formed United States government on sound footing. Hamilton’ s first report on public credit did not mention a national bank, it only dealt with the state and foreign bonds left over from the revolutionary war. The report called for:

1) Assumption of the state and foreign bonds that were trading around 20-25% of their face value.

2) Paying off these state and foreign bonds at their face value by issuing new federal bonds.

3) Tariffs and tonnage duties would back these new federal bonds.

The result of this legislation, according to Wikipedia was:

The adoption of Hamilton’s Report had the immediate effect of converting what had been virtually worthless federal and state certificates of indebtedness into $60 million of funded government securities. Fully funded, the central government regained the ability to borrow, attracting foreign investment as social unrest destabilized Europe. In addition, the newly issued bonds provided a circulating currency, stimulating business investment.**[11]**

Hamilton’s plan worked brilliantly and it had nothing to do with a National Bank.

The national bank was proposed in a separate report. Hamilton would not have been in favor of a central bank. Hamilton believed that a bank run by the government would be tempted print too much money.**[12]** The First National Bank was not a central bank, however it was a government chartered and supported enterprise sort of like Fannie Mae and not strictly a free market enterprise either. Such enterprises are prone to inside deals.

Most people point to the Second National Bank of the United States, created in the Madison administration, as a central bank. The Second National Bank was modeled after the First National Bank, except it had some regulatory authority over other banks. This made it closer to a central bank, however it did not have the power of legal tender or a monopoly on the issuance of money. Apparently, the Second National Bank was poorly run and became involved in politics. Andrew Jackson refused to renew its charter so its operations ended in 1836. The information I could find on the Second National Bank was sparse compared to the First National Bank.

The first real central bank in the United States is the Federal Reserve, which was created in 1913. The Federal Reserve is a private entity of sorts. It is more like Fannie Mae than a true private bank however. It has the power to create legal tender, it is tasked with setting interest rates to achieve policy goals, and it has regulatory control over the whole banking system in the United States.

There were two main justifications for the Federal Reserve: 1) the United States needed a lender of last resort to avoid banking panics, and 2) the idea that the United States government almost went bankrupt a couple of times, but JP Morgan saved the day.**[13]**

The United States did suffer from a number of bank panics, but these were due to over-regulation, not the free market. Oddly, finance (stocks and bonds) was not regulated hardly at all in the United States until the Kansas’ Blue Sky Law in 1911, which was the blue print for the Securities Act of 1933. Banks on the other hand were highly regulated, the most obvious of these regulations were unit banking laws. Unit banking laws required that banks could have only one location and these laws existed in a number of states and was applied to federal banks. These resulted in a lack of diversification in banks’ portfolios, which increased their risk of failure.**[14]** Canada did not have these restrictions. Canada had many nationwide banks and as a result did not have a single bank fail during the Great Depression.**[15]**

Private banks had already created clearing houses that acted as a lender of last resort, before the Federal Reserve.

Friedman understood . . . that before the Federal Reserve Act financial panics in the US were mitigated by the actions of private commercial bank clearinghouses. Friedman and Schwartz’s view of the 1930′s was that the Fed, having nationalized the roles of the clearinghouse associations [CHAs], particularly the lender-of-last-resort role, did less to mitigate the panic than the CHAs had done in earlier panics like 1907 and 1893. In that sense, the economy would have been better off if the Fed had not been created. This position is perfectly consistent with the position that, provided we take the Fed’s nationalization of the clearinghouse roles for granted, the Fed was guilty of not doing its job.**[16]**

The idea that the United States needed a central bank, is not justified by the banking failures before the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve failed in this function during the Great Depression.

The other justification for the creation of the Federal Reserve was the supposed bailouts of the United States federal government in 1893 and 1907 by JP Morgan. The United States was on a gold standard and the government’s gold reserves were being depleted rapidly in both cases. In both cases Morgan guaranteed to buy bonds issued to purchase gold for the United States Treasury. These bonds were sold on the strength and credit of the United States and Morgan profited by both of these so-called bailouts. If the Treasury had been doing its job correctly it would have cultivated a market for these bonds long before this crisis. In addition, the federal government could also have slashed spending. Not surprisingly the bailout of 1907 happened under the bad economic policies of Teddy Roosevelt. In addition, the United States had the power to issue legal tender, which it could have done to conserve its gold. The history surrounding these events is confused and has not been fully explored. This paper is not full exploration of this topic, however it raises serious doubts that the narrative of these panics was a legitimate justification for the creation of the Federal Reserve.

Another narrative pushed by the banking interests is that somehow banks are different than other businesses. Banks always argue that if one bank (large politically connected bank) fails then the whole banking system will collapse. This narrative is trotted out every time banks demand a bailout, the most recent being the bailouts in 2008. When a bank fails it goes through bankruptcy, which acts as a circuit breaker from a cascading series of failures. This is exactly what happens in other areas of the economy. Another solution that I do not endorse, but is better than bailouts, was the Resolution Trust Corporation that was created to liquidate the savings and loan failures of the late 1980s. The Resolution Trust Corporation was essentially a massive bankruptcy proceeding and importantly its existence was limited. It had to liquidate all its assets by 1992 (five year life).

The justifications of for the Federal Reserve are weak at best and considering the damage the Federal Reserve has done to the economy and its potential for abuse it should be ended. The origins of the Federal Reserve are based on government failure, specifically interference in a free market.

What we have learned:

*Central banks do not arise naturally in a free market and are not part of a free market.

*Central banks and legal tender laws are the source of inflation, not private fractional reserve banks.

*Central banks provide an easy way to obscure that the central bank and the government are creating inflation.

*Lowering interest rates causes a one-time increase in the money supply over the trend line.

*The fastest way to undermine (eliminate) the Federal Reserve is to eliminate legal tender laws.

## Preface to Part 2

  
  

This book is about the most important question in economics: What is the source of economic growth? It is concerned with real per capita increases in wealth or income, which is what matters to most of us. Surprisingly, very little attention has been paid to this question by the economics' profession. I will survey the history of thinking on this subject by economists.

There has been significant empirical study of economic freedom. This work shows the wealthiest countries are those with the greatest economic freedom. However, this has not been incorporated into a school of economic thought. One of the questions raised by these studies is why countries with lower economic freedom ratings (sometimes much lower) have economic growth rates that are two or more times greater than the growth rates for the most economically free countries. This book explains why that occurs and why economic freedom is connected with economic success.

The book is roughly divided into three parts of unequal length. The first part is directed to what economists call new growth theory. The second part of the book is directed to the area called bioeconomics or thermoeconomics and starts at Chapter 11, Entropy, Evolution, Economics. It provides a deeper understanding and broadening of the thesis developed in part one. The third part combines all into a school of economic thought that I label intellectual capitalism.

I will answer a number of key questions including: What is the source of real per capita economic growth?; Why did the Industrial Revolution start when and where it did?; Why is economic growth associated with economic freedom?; and How are economically less free countries able to have higher growth rates than more economically free countries?

Chapter 1 provides a quick overview of the thesis of this book.

Chapter 2 provides an overview of what economists throughout history have said is the cause of real per capita economic growth.

Chapter 3 explains that inventions are the source of all real per capita increases in wealth.

Chapter 4 discusses how most of the common definitions of the study of economics are misleading and provides an alternative definition.

Chapter 5 shows that property rights for inventions were critical to increasing the rate of invention so that large numbers of people could escape the Malthusian trap.

Chapter 6 provides a review of the historical evidence for patents being the key property right for economic growth.

Chapter 7 examines some of the academic arguments against patents.

Chapter 8 examines the arguments over whether patents are property rights.

Chapter 9 is an overview of scholars who have examined the process of invention.

Chapter 10 lays out six natural laws of invention.

Chapter 11 discusses how our accounting systems fail to recognize the economic value of inventions and how to fix this.

Chapter 12 shows the relationship between entropy, evolution and economics.

Chapter 13 examines whether inventions are subject to diminishing returns.

Chapter 14 provides the foundations of a school of economics that incorporates the insights from examining the source of all real per capita increases in wealth.

Chapter 15 is an imaginary interview with a person from the future fifty years after the policies suggested by this book have been implemented.

No school of economics is currently consistent with natural rights, which was the founding principle upon which the United States legal system is built and, therefore, its economy. Natural rights are also the underpinning of most, if not all, 19th century common law countries. This book proposes a school of economic thinking that is consistent with natural rights. As used herein, natural rights is the logical system that starts with the axiom that you own yourself.

There is some repetition because the author wanted that section of the book to stand on its own or because the concept has been so distorted in present dialogs that it was necessary to clarify the issue. Where concepts are addressed that have been so distorted in current dialogs of thought, definitions will be reinforced for clarification.

The book provides some footnotes. Because of the Internet, the structure and purpose of footnotes are changing. As a result, I have decided that the formal rules on the structure of footnotes are antiquated and no longer serve their purpose.

## Chapter 1: Thesis

  
  

Humans are different from every other organism on Earth in that they alter their environment to meet their needs while organisms alter themselves to adapt to the environment. The way man does this is he uses his mind to create inventions that will solve a problem of his existence. Throughout history, the rate at which new inventions were created was relatively slow and the increase in the standard of living of the inventor and those around him was quickly swamped by increases in population and the effects of diminishing returns. For instance, the advent of agriculture made the first farmers wealthier since farming took less than a tenth of the land to support each person.[3](#sdfootnote3sym) However, increases in human population and declining fertility of soil quickly swamped this effect, and the result was a larger, but not wealthier, population. Historically, population increases and diminishing returns have combined to ensure that people lived on the edge of starvation, which is commonly referred to the Malthusian trap.

This situation of stagnant, subsistence levels of per capita wealth lasted until a small group of English-speaking people started the Industrial Revolution around 1800. Then, for the first time, a significant part of the population was able to escape the Malthusian trap even with a rapidly increasing population. This short history of the economy of man raises two of the most important questions in economics: 1) What is the cause of real per capita increases in income? and 2) Why did a relatively small group of English-speaking people suddenly break out of the Malthusian trap when they did? Strangely enough, neither of these questions has received significant attention from the economics profession.

We have already answered the first question. The only way man can alter his environment to increase his standard of living is to create new inventions. However to increase his standard of living he has to create new inventions that increase his wealth at a rate faster than increases in population and diminishing returns deteriorate his wealth.

This book defines economics in a slightly different way than most of the economics profession. Economics is the study of how man obtains those things he needs for his survival. This definition avoids the disembodied idea of resources and makes clear that resources must be created by people before they can be distributed or consumed.

The reason the Industrial Revolution, which should be called the Invention Revolution, started with English-speaking people, is that they were the first to provide large numbers of people the opportunity for property rights in their inventions, commonly known as patents. As noted by the economist Hernando de Soto and many other economists, property rights are the key to maximizing the output from a resource. The most important resource is man’s mind’s ability to create new inventions to improve our lives

Adam Smith published his famous treatise on economics, _An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,_ in 1776, which is considered the start of the study of economics. It is important to note that he was writing about the wealth of nations, not the wealth of people. Smith was skeptical that large groups of people would ever escape the Malthusian trap. In the 239 years since Smith published _The_ _Wealth of Nations_, we have gone from inventing the steam ship, to the steam-powered train, to the car, to airplanes, to jets, to spaceships that have left the solar system. In the 240 years before Smith published _The_ _Wealth of Nations_ there were very few new inventions. The moveable type printing press (in Europe) had been invented over three hundred years earlier, and most people still could not afford a book. James Watt had just invented his improved steam engine, which was used to pump water from coal mines, but steam-powered ships and steam-powered trains had not been invented. Some of the inventions necessary for creating inexpensive cloth had been invented, such as the spinning jenny, but the cotton gin had not been invented, and all of these machines relied on human power or water wheels. Practical sewing machines were not available for another seventy years. Smith and most modern economists confine their research to a technologically stagnant economy. Most of modern economics relies on the _ceteris paribus_ (all other things being equal) assumption, which includes no new technologies. However, the most important questions in economics revolve around the creation of new technologies.

If you had told Smith in 1776 that the median person’s real income in the United Kingdom would grow by a factor of 60 and by a factor of 88 for the American colonists over the next 240 years, he would have questioned your sanity. If you told him this would occur while the world’s population expanded by over 8 times and that 86% of world population would escape the Malthusian, he would have been sure that you should be committed to an insane asylum. After all, real per capita median wages had never changed in history, and the population of the world had expanded by just 1.5 times in the preceding 250 years before _The_ _Wealth of Nations_.

This book explains how this occurred and what policies are necessary to ensure that this trend continues.

  
  

## Chapter 2: Introduction: History of Economic Thought on Economic Growth

  
  

The single most important question in economics is: What causes economic growth? Surprisingly, very little attention in economics has been directed to this question. In this chapter, we will take a quick tour of economic thought about growth from Adam Smith to the leading new growth economic theorists.

Adam Smith, the father of economics, suggested three ways in which the annual output of a country could be increased.[4](#sdfootnote4sym) First, is an increase in the population, second is the division of labor, and third is “some addition and improvement to those machines and instruments which facilitate and abridge labor.”[5](#sdfootnote5sym) This book is concerned with the causes of real per capita economic growth, which improves the life of the average person, not the “wealth of a nation.”

There are places with high population densities that are very rich and some that are very poor. There is no support in the modern world for any correlation between population or population density and per capita gross domestic product (GDP).[6](#sdfootnote6sym)

The second factor Smith mentions is division of labor. Smith provides the following example to prove his point:

To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture; but one in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of the pin-maker; a workman not educated to this business (which the division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands; though in others, the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor and, therefore, indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are, in a pound, upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations.[7](#sdfootnote7sym) (Emphasis added)

Smith provides three reasons why division of labor increases wealth: “a) improves the dexterity of the worker; b) allows the worker to save the time necessary to switch among different activities; c) puts the worker in the condition of inventing machines to facilitate his job.”[8](#sdfootnote8sym) Improving the dexterity of workers would certainly make them more efficient at their work, but there are clearly limits to this. Once everyone is at peak dexterity, growth would stop. Present management theory is emphasizing cross training among employees, rather than greater and greater specialization. Smith’s second reason, saving time in switching between tasks, has the same limitations as his first reason; it reaches a limit and growth stops. His third reason, inventing, overlaps his “some addition and improvement to those machines and instruments which facilitate and abridge labor.” We will cover inventions in much more detail later in this book. More generally, there certainly is a positive correlation between the division of labor and per capita GDP, but the problem is one of cause and effect. Is division of labor the result of a technologically sophisticated economy or does an advanced economy result because of the division of labor? Smith recognizes that there are limitations to the division of labor based on the size of the market.

As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market. When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he has occasion for.[9](#sdfootnote9sym)

Smith’s argument suggests that a larger population would provide more incentive for the division of labor and there does appear to be some evidence for this, but there is no evidence in the modern world for increased population causing increased per capita income.

Smith was part of the group of classical economists that included David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus. In classical economics, the inputs to the economy are land, labor, and capital.[10](#sdfootnote10sym) Technological progress was seen to be a function of capital accumulation. Smith postulated a continually decreasing return on capital, which will eventually lead to a stagnant economy.[11](#sdfootnote11sym) Malthus is famous for his statement that human population would always grow faster than the food supply. Malthus is often derided by free market proponents, but he was right for all of human existence until about the time he made this statement. In the 1800s, only a small part of the world population was able to escape this Malthusian trap. Even today, about 14% of the world’s population lives at this level, the Malthusian trap, when people live on the edge of starvation. All animals (organisms) live in this state, except man. Malthus’ idea turned out to be a key insight into evolution.[12](#sdfootnote12sym)

Ricardo and Malthus are credited with discovering the principle of diminishing returns.[13](#sdfootnote13sym) This dooms humans to subsistence living in the long run according to these economists. Ricardo was of the opinion that new inventions might provide short-term increases in people’s standard of livings, but these would be temporary.[14](#sdfootnote14sym) David Walsh, in his book _Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations: A Story of Economic Discovery,_ suggests this pessimism by Ricardo and Malthus was the result of the Napoleonic Wars.[15](#sdfootnote15sym) It is not surprising that economics was named “the dismal science.”

By the time John Stuart Mill writes his economic treatise, _Principles,_ in 1848, it is no longer possible to ignore the progress (increases in real per capita income) resulting from the Industrial Revolution. His solution is to propose the steady state economy.[16](#sdfootnote16sym) The economy would grow until it matured. This preserved the concept of diminishing returns, but without the depressing fall back to the Malthusian trap. When the economy reached its peak or steady state, then everyone could relax. The steady state economy would be characterized by roughly equal wealth across the population and if not, then wealth redistribution would make it so.[17](#sdfootnote17sym)

The Austrian School of economics has not been highly interested in the question of the causes of economic growth, instead focusing on the causes of the business cycle. But Ludwig Von Mises did tackle this question, and his answer was free markets, which lead to increases in productivity resulting in high savings rates that facilitate new technologies and entrepreneurs that increase productivity.[18](#sdfootnote18sym) Why do free markets lead to increases in productivity? Why do high savings rates result in new technologies? His answer ultimately is capitalism, but Mises fails to explain what it is about capitalism that causes economic growth. It is like a doctor saying cancer is caused by the uncontrolled growth of cells without explaining why these cells have uncontrolled growth.

Joseph Schumpeter’s answer to the cause of economic growth was creative destruction in which new businesses introducing new technologies destroy older businesses using older less efficient (or otherwise less desirable) technologies. Creative destruction suffers similar problems as Mises’ explanation without even the explanation of free markets. The new businesses are motivated by the prospect of obtaining high profit margins according to Schumpeter but, presumably, this was always the case. What starts this cycle and why did it, the Industrial Revolution, start in England and the US? Why did it not start elsewhere and what policies encourage this? The ultimate question that neither Mises nor Schumpeter answers is: How does this overcome diminishing returns?

John Maynard Keynes introduced the idea of central planning to macroeconomics and turned the economic profession on its head by arguing that private savings was bad for the economy, and somehow consumption created economic growth. There has never been any evidence for Keynes’ position. Keynes was not really concerned with economic growth, but in “optimizing” the economy like it was some sort of internal combustion engine. The eventual result of this was the introduction of the mathematical techniques of quantum mechanics into economics.[19](#sdfootnote19sym) These techniques have solved a number of optimization problems, but have nothing to say about what causes economic growth.

The next step in growth theory was the Harrod-Domar model. This model states the rate of economic growth in an economy is dependent on the level of saving and the capital output ratio, where the capital output ratio can be thought of as the return on capital. This model is a small variation on the classical economics formulation that increases in capital cause economic growth. This model fails to explain why real per capita suddenly takes off, why this occurs in the US and England, or how it overcomes diminishing returns.

The first real advance in modern economic growth theory was by Robert Solow, who won the Nobel Prize in economics because of his work in this area. His model suggests that 87.5% of the economic growth of the U.S. during the middle of the 20th century is the result of technological progress. His paper “Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function” was about total GDP, not increases in real per capita GDP.[20](#sdfootnote20sym) Solow argues technology growth is exogenous, which means it just happens and is independent of economic policy, like some sort of background radiation. Solow’s model did not explain why certain countries progressed faster technologically resulting in significant real per capita economic growth and other countries did not. Solow is a Keynesian and has tried to graft his results into this framework, including preserving the idea of perfect competition.

Paul Romer is the standard-bearer of the endogenous growth theory movement in modern economics. Endogenous growth means that economic policies can affect the rate at which new technologies are developed and, therefore, economic growth rates.

Romer explains his thesis as, “Human history teaches us … that economic growth springs from better recipes, not just from more cooking.”[21](#sdfootnote21sym) Romer seems to use the term “recipes” for inventions, knowledge, or technology and cooking as manufacturing. He carries the cooking analogy further.

Economic growth occurs whenever people take resources and rearrange them in ways that are more valuable. A useful metaphor for production in an economy comes from the kitchen. To create valuable final products, we mix inexpensive ingredients together according to a recipe.[22](#sdfootnote22sym)

Without new recipes, we would run out of ingredients (natural resources), according to Romer.[23](#sdfootnote23sym) "Every generation has perceived the limits to growth that finite resources and undesirable side effects would pose if no new recipes or ideas were discovered. And every generation has underestimated the potential for finding new recipes and ideas. We consistently fail to grasp how many ideas remain to be discovered. The difficulty is the same one we have with compounding: possibilities do not merely add up; they multiply.”[24](#sdfootnote24sym)

According to Romer, there are essentially an unlimited number of potential inventions. He uses the following example to illustrate this point:

On any conceivable horizon — I’ll say until about 5 billion years from now, when the sun explodes — we’re not going to run out of discoveries. Just ask how many things we could make by taking the elements from the periodic table and mixing them together. There’s a simple mathematical calculation: It’s 10 followed by 30 zeros. In contrast, 10 followed by 19 zeros is about how much time has elapsed since the universe was created.[25](#sdfootnote25sym)

Someone might object that Paul Romer overstated the number of possible chemical inventions since not all elements are able to bind chemically to each other. On the other hand, this calculation only includes one of each element. Some of our most important chemical compounds contain long chains of carbon and silicon atoms. In addition, the elements can bond to each other in multiple ways, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds. Elements may also have double, triple, and quadruple bonds. Plus, chemical elements are three dimensional, not a simple linear permutation. When you add in all these variations, Romer has seriously underestimated the number of possible chemical inventions. This calculation is only for chemistry. When you consider computer networks or electronic circuits with billions of transistors in a single microprocessor or nodes, the number of different possible connections is n(n-1)/2 or easily equal to the number of combinations described for chemistry.

Another example that Romer uses to illustrate the unlimited number of possible combinations is all the possible bit streams you can turn into a CD-ROM. The number is something in the range of 10 to the power of 1 billion, which virtually ensures that we will never run out of software to discover. He notes that there is not enough mass in the universe to make that number of CDs.[26](#sdfootnote26sym) Romer’s answer to the problem of diminishing returns is new recipes. But what policies does he suggest will cause the creation of new recipes?

Romer takes sort of a backward way of explaining what policies he thinks lead to growth. First, he shows it is not about capital or natural resources.

Thinking about ideas and recipes changes how one thinks about economic policy (and cows). A traditional explanation for the persistent poverty of many less developed countries is that they lack objects such as natural resources or capital goods. But Japan had little of either in 1950 and still has few natural resources, so something else must be involved.[27](#sdfootnote27sym)

Next, he explains how third world countries can grow. All they have to do is adopt the recipes that have already been created. He explains that many third world countries have policies that limit the adoption or dispersion of modern technology.

But car firms in India operate in a government-created protective time warp. The Hillman and Austin cars produced in England in the fifties continue to roll off production lines in India today. India's commitment to closing itself off and striving for self-sufficiency has been as strong as Japan's commitment to acquiring foreign ideas and participating fully in world markets. The outcomes—grinding poverty in India and opulence in Japan—could hardly be more disparate.

For a developing country like India, enormous increases in standards of living could be achieved merely by letting in the ideas held by companies from industrialized nations.[28](#sdfootnote28sym)

However, countries with advanced economies cannot advance by adopting the technologies of other countries.

But leading countries like the United States and Canada, and new leaders like Japan, cannot stay ahead merely by adopting ideas developed elsewhere. They must also offer incentives for the discovery of new ideas at home, and this is not easy to do. The same characteristic that makes an idea so valuable—everybody can use it at the same time—also means that it is hard to earn an appropriate rate of return on investments in ideas. The many people who benefit from a new idea can too easily free-ride on the efforts of others.[29](#sdfootnote29sym)

There have been two broad systems for encouraging the development of new technologies: 1) property rights for inventions, i.e., patents, and 2) rewards or prizes for inventors. Romer is ambivalent about patents. Romer makes the distinction between physical property, which is rivalrous, and inventions, or recipes as he calls them, which are non-rivalrous.[30](#sdfootnote30sym) He claims:

With ideas, you have this tension: You want high prices to motivate discovery, but you want low prices to achieve efficient, widespread use. You can't with a single price achieve both, so if you push things into the market, you try to compromise between those two, and it's often an unhappy compromise.[31](#sdfootnote31sym)

Romer likes the incentive patents provide for creating new inventions.[32](#sdfootnote32sym) However, he believes that it slows dissemination of new technologies and results in monopolistic competition. He further states: “Because everybody can use the idea at the same time, there's no tragedy of the commons in the intellectual sphere. There's no problem of overuse or overgrazing or overfishing an idea.”[33](#sdfootnote33sym) Romer’s statement is misleading as it applied to inventions and patents. As soon as the invention is realized in a physical form, then the invention is subject to the same scarcity issues as any other good or service. The total market for an invention is limited (scarce) at a particular point in time, and the goods and services necessary to realize an invention in its physical form are scarce.[34](#sdfootnote34sym) When the infringer of a patent makes the invention, he reduces the market value of the invention to the inventor. Patent law recognizes that ideas cannot be overused by too many people knowing about them, and it encourages the spread of ideas by publishing inventions that are patented. A primary goal of a patent system is the spread of technical information. Before modern patent systems, people and companies kept their inventions secret because this was the only way to ensure they profited from their discoveries instead of their competitors. In the U.S., our patent system created a number of patent depository libraries to encourage the spread of technical information. It is one of the requirements of patents that the information on how to “practice the invention” is part of the quid pro quo for receiving a property right for your invention. Specifically, 35 USC 112 states:

The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.

Romer’s statement that ideas are not subject to the tragedy of the commons is misleading in another sense also. One of the problems with commons is that when no one owns a resource, no one invests in the resource—or at least, they underinvest in the resource. A system of property rights for inventions is not the unhappy compromise that Romer suggests. It encourages the spread of information about inventions, and it provides incentives to both create new inventions and to invest in the dissemination of inventions. Romer implies that it takes no resources to disseminate new inventions:

There are some kinds of ideas where, once those ideas are uncovered, you'd like to make them as broadly available as possible, so everybody in the world can put them to good use. There we find it efficient to give those ideas away for free and encourage everybody to use them. If you're going to be giving things away for free, you're going to have to find some system to finance them, and that's where government support typically comes in.

Let me give an extreme example. Oral rehydration therapy is one of those few ideas which did actually jump immediately from science to consumer benefit. It's a simple scientific insight about how you can save the life of a child who's suffering from diarrhea. Literally millions of lives have been saved with it. So what price should you charge people for using it?

Because everybody can use the idea at the same time, there's no tragedy of the commons in the intellectual sphere. There's no problem of overuse or overgrazing or overfishing an idea. If you give an idea away for free, you don't get any of the problems when you try and give objects away for free. So the efficient thing for society is to offer really big rewards for some scientist who discovers an oral rehydration therapy. But then as soon as we discover it, we give the idea away for free to everybody throughout the world and explain "Just use this little mixture of basically sugar and salt, put it in water, and feed that to a kid who's got diarrhea because if you give them pure water you'll kill them." So with ideas, you have this tension: You want high prices to motivate discovery, but you want low prices to achieve efficient, widespread use.

Mr. Romer’s example is misleading. It takes real resources to spread new technologies and information. If there were no scarcity for the adoption of technology, we would expect that in the absence of intellectual property rights new technologies would be adopted instantly and universally. Scientific principles are not subject to intellectual property rights. Calculus was discovered over 300 year ago and is not the subject of intellectual property rights. Despite this, only a small percentage of the population understands it, even in the most advanced economies. Those people who do understand calculus generally paid an instructor to learn this area of math even though books on the subject can be reviewed free at many libraries. Almost everything a student learns through formal education, even in graduate school, is information that is freely available. Even if the textbook is copyrighted, the information is usually available in a non-copyrighted form or available free from a library. Despite this, the U.S. spends over $500 billion per year on all forms of education.

According to venture capitalists, most start-ups will spend 2-10 times the amount on marketing (disseminating) their inventions than on developing them. If the distribution of ideas were free, not subject to scarcity, this would clearly be unnecessary.

University professors, doctors, lawyers, engineers, judges, marketers, sales people, and computer scientists are mainly in the business of distributing or implementing known information. If distributing information is free, not subject to scarcity, then all these people should either be thrown in jail for fraud or paid less than the average day laborer.

The U.S. has historically provided the strongest legal protection for inventions.[35](#sdfootnote35sym) The U.S. is not only the leader in the creation of new technologies but has had the fastest adoption and most widespread diffusion of new technologies. Countries that had or have weak patent laws are associated with the slowest adoption and diffusion rates for new technologies.

Paul Romer is fairly vague on his solution to encourage the creation of new recipes. He seems to suggest the government should fund research and development more aggressively and then give away the recipes. Romer is a Keynesian in the mathematical mold that uses the tools of quantum mechanics to analyze the economy. Like Solow, he tries to graft his insights about the technology driving the economy with Keynesian concepts including pure and perfect competition. This leads to one of his complaints about patents that they lead to monopolistic competition. As most Keynesians, he sees a bigger role for government while recognizing the potential problems of government inefficiencies. He is ambivalent about intellectual property rights and patents more particularly. He likes the incentive they provide to create new technologies, but finds them inefficient based on a perfect competition analysis for the dissemination of inventions. (Perfect competition will be discussed in much more detail in Chapter 6.)

  
  

  
  

## Chapter 3: Inventions as the Source of Economic Growth

One of the common themes for most economists who have explored the question of economic growth, from Adam Smith to Paul Romer, is that new technologies or inventions are a source of economic growth and the most recent evidence is that inventions (increasing levels of technology) are the source of all economic growth. Unfortunately, Romer uses the somewhat vague term _recipes_ and Solow was rather indefinite in what he meant by technical change, which he also called _the residual_. In order to avoid this sort of confusion, I will define an invention as a human creation that has an objective result, i.e., the effect of which is demonstrable repeatedly, measurable objectively, and independent of the observer. For instance, the invention of an incandescent light bulb has the objective result of putting out light when the appropriate electrical signal is applied. Note that inventions are always about a class of objects, not an individual object (instance). While art is a human creation that has a subjective result, the effect of which is the reaction of the observer, which not only varies from observer to observer, but may also vary over time in the same observer. For instance, the movie _Casablanca_, my reaction will be different from your reaction. Art does not have an objective result. This can become confusing because movies are an invention. A specific movie is a human creation with a subjective result while the class of objects called movies is an invention; actually, a modern movie is a combination of many inventions. Note that a piece of art, such as the movie _Casablanca_, is also a class of objects. There are multiple videotapes, digital copies, and even film copies of _Casablanca_. Art and inventions together are the complete set of human creations.

Manufacturing is distinct from invention and is the process of recreating an invention. If I produce a hundred bikes, I have recreated the invention of a bicycle a hundred times. If I re-engineer a bike to make it smaller for a child, it is still a bicycle. Neither of these meets the definition of an invention; they are reproduction. (The Appendix, Inventions and Art, has more detail on this subject).

With these definitions in hand, does it make sense logically that inventions are the source of economic growth? Man is a rational animal.[36](#sdfootnote36sym) This means that man’s defining characteristic is his ability to think, and he uses his rational faculty to create things (inventions) that increase his chance of survival.[37](#sdfootnote37sym) Man is not the strongest animal, not the fastest, does not have the strongest jaws, or sharpest teeth. He is not best adapted to extreme cold or heat, does not breed the fastest, and yet man is found almost everywhere on Earth. The only way to explain the success of Homo sapiens is their ability to reason. We do not create things to improve our lives just by thinking about them; they must be implemented physically. For instance, the knowledge of how to produce a fire by itself does not cook your food, heat you, or keep wild animals away unless you use the knowledge to create a fire.

Our level of technology defines our standard of living. Imagine if we suddenly had the same technology our ancestors had in 1600. Would we be any wealthier than they were? You might think that we are stronger and live longer. But why would we be stronger or live longer when we have the same food sources, the same medicine, the same shelter, the same sanitation as our ancestors from 1600? We would not. Our technology defines our standard of living.

Inventions are the creation of new technologies that allow us to solve a problem of human existence. For instance, the electric light is an invention to make light less expensive, which allows us to work later, see what we are working on, resulting in fewer errors, and allows us to read and study at night. Production also provides us things for our survival, but it has an upper limit. Once every farmer has a steam tractor, producing more steam tractors will not result in farming that is more productive. Only inventions (new technologies) can continue to increase real per capita income.

  
  

## Chapter 4: Definition of Economics

This book is about economics. Before we go any further, I think it is important that we define the term. There are actually a number of definitions. Here is a sample from Wikipedia:

  
  

The philosopher Adam Smith (1776) defines the subject as “an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, in particular as: a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objective of providing] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people ... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services.”

J. B. Say (1803), distinguishing the subject from its public policy uses, defines it as the science _of_ production, distribution, and consumption of wealth.

John Stuart Mill (1844) defines the subject in a social context as: “The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth, in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object.”

Alfred Marshall provides a still widely-cited definition in his textbook _Principles of Economics_ (1890) that extends analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level: Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.

Lionel Robbins (1932) developed implications of what has been termed "[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject": Economics is a science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.

Robbins describes the definition as not _classificatory_ in "pick[ing] out certain _kinds_ of behaviour" but rather _analytical_ in "focus[ing] attention on a particular _aspect_ of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity."[38](#sdfootnote38sym)

I think Say’s definition and Robbins' are the best, but still fail to capture the essence of economics, which, in this book, is defined as the study of how man obtains those things he needs to live. I have three justifications for this definition. One of the reasons we engage in the economy (e.g., manufacture, sell, trade, invent, market) is we need things in order to survive. I will not distinguish between subsistence living and thriving because every study shows that longevity is closely tied to your wealth and the wealth of the country in which you live. Two, I think this definition is more useful in focusing our attention on the source of economic growth. Three, this definition focuses on the individual. As a result, it preserves Robinson Crusoe economics, or that economics applies to a man on a deserted island, which is useful for examining a number of economic concepts including the source of economic growth.

My definition does not specifically mention scarcity or resources. Part of the reason for this is that scarcity can be confused with the idea that economy is a zero-sum game. Resources sound like they are just lying about the street, as if anyone could pick them up, and ignores that these so-called resources have to be produced, mined, distributed, invented, etc. Resources are not just lying about, and the economy is not a zero-sum game. The definition in this book is clear that man must use effort to obtain those things necessary for life, so this definition does preserve scarcity correctly interpreted. As well, it incorporates the idea of resources if correctly interpreted. Comparing it to Say’s, this book’s definition includes the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth, but also includes invention and focuses on why this is necessary.

Applying this definition, Robinson Crusoe engages in activities to obtain the things necessary to sustain his life, so he is a proper subject for the study of economics. For example, fishing is production. He also makes economic trades. For instance, if he goes fishing today he cannot build a house, plant a field, collect firewood, or invent. Crusoe has to decide among all these possible activities and decide what is most beneficial for him. If he chooses incorrectly, he will be poorer or even die. All of these are economic activities; the only difference is that he does not trade, which is the only reason for money. Now, if Crusoe uses a sharpened stick to hunt fish, his skill may improve over time but at some point the number of fish he can catch per day will reach a maximum. But, if he invents a fishing net, the number of fish he can catch will increase by orders of magnitude. Now, he will be wealthier, even if he was catching enough fish to feed himself before. He can either catch more fish and dry them to eat later or he can use the extra time to build a better shelter or dig a well or irrigation ditch. If we add more people to our economy, it does not change the fact that without inventions there is no way to increase real per capita wealth.

  
  

## Chapter 5: Patents, Property Rights for Inventions, are the Key to Economic Growth

Hernando de Soto has shown that the key to unlocking the power of assets is legal property rights. “The core of the capitalist system, as I understand it, is that it is essentially a legal property system,” argues de Soto. Making assets fungible by making them legal could unblock trillions of dollars in “dead capital.”[39](#sdfootnote39sym) The story of the Pilgrims illustrates this point clearly. Originally, the Pilgrims tried a collective with communal farms and communal distribution of their products. The result was that they almost starved. The next year, 1623, they decided that each family would own their parcel of land. The result was greatly improved productivity from the same land.

This change, Bradford wrote, had very good success, for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been. Giving people economic incentives changed their behavior. Once the new system of property rights was in place, the women now went willingly into the field, and took their little ones with them to set corn; which before would allege weakness and inability.[40](#sdfootnote40sym)

This natural experiment has been repeated many times. Property rights in assets result in significantly improved returns from those assets.

Since inventions are the source of economic growth, it only makes sense that if you want to increase economic growth you will provide property rights for inventions. Inventions, in many ways, are similar to undiscovered minerals. Without property rights, no one has the incentive to explore for these minerals and once found, to spend the money to extract them. A rational person trying to acquire those things necessary to improve their life is not going to expend much time on creating an invention when they cannot get a return on their time and effort. There is a tragedy of the commons for inventions and it is the failure to exploit this resource without property rights, similar to the tragedy of the commons that happens when people cannot acquire rights in the minerals they discover. The historical alternative to property rights in inventions has been some sort of prize, stipend, annuity (sort of like a poet laureate), etc., which we will call cash prizes. Next, we will examine the historical evidence for the effectiveness of these methods of encouraging the creation of new inventions.

## Chapter 6: Historical Evidence

The first known patent law was in Venice, which passed the Patent Decree of 1474.[41](#sdfootnote41sym) The statute is reproduced below:

WE HAVE among us men of great genius, apt to invent and discover ingenious devices; and in view of the grandeur and virtue of our City, more such men come to us from diverse parts. Now if provision were made for the works and devices discovered by such persons, so that others who may see them could not build them and take the inventor’s honor away, more men would then apply their genius, would discover, and would build devices of great utility and benefit to our Commonwealth.

Therefore:

BE IT ENACTED that, by the authority of this Council, every person who shall build any new and ingenious device in this City, not previously made in this Commonwealth, shall give notice of it to the office of our General Welfare Board when it has been reduced to perfection so that it can be used and operated. It being forbidden to every other person in any of our territories and towns to make any further device conforming with and similar to said one, without the consent and license of the author, for the term of 10 years. And if anybody builds it in violation hereof, the aforesaid author and inventor shall be entitled to have him summoned before any magistrate of this City, by which Magistrate the said infringer shall be constrained to pay him [one] hundred ducats; and the device shall be destroyed at once. It being, however, within the power and discretion of the Government, in its activities, to take and use any such device and instrument, with this condition however that no one but the author shall operate it.[42](#sdfootnote42sym)

There were other pseudo patent laws in Europe after the Venice Patent Decree. I label them as such because they were not directed at protecting the rights of inventors, but in acquiring inventions from other countries. England slowly developed an archaic patent system, starting with the Statute of Monopolies of 1623. But it did not effectively protect inventors’ rights until about 1800. The United States and the colonies had patent systems roughly modeled on England’s. The (original) US Constitution only mentions one RIGHT and that is the rights of inventors and authors, i.e., patents and copyrights. It was not until the Patent Act of 1836 that the US created the first truly modern patent system. A modern patent system is characterized here by an examination system administered by an independent professional examination corps that is readily accessible to all inventors (as opposed to only wealthy or politically connected inventors, see England in the 1800s), has a system for widely publishing patents, and provides a freely alienable property right. An effective patent system was not available for a large number of people until around 1800.

Most likely, there were prizes, salaries, etc. for inventors on an informal basis going back to at least ancient Greece. It is very difficult to gather much information about these systems. We will leave the question of the effectiveness of these cash prizes for stimulating inventions until we get to modern times.

Did people invent before patent laws were created? Absolutely. Patents are not required for people to invent, and this appears to suggest that there is some exogenous component to inventions. However, it would be outrageous to suggest that none of these inventors intended to profit from their inventions. Many intended to profit from their inventions by keeping them secret. The Middle Ages were characterized by trade guilds that kept inventions trade secrets, which allowed members of the guild to profit from them. Also, some inventors may have gained enough profit from using the invention in their own operations to justify the investment, even if other people were able to copy their invention.

What was the rate of invention before patent systems? Economists have studied this question. For instance, Michael Kremmer studied the rate of technological change from one million BC to 1990 and found that the rate of invention is mainly determined by population.[43](#sdfootnote43sym) There also appears to be some relationship between population density and the rate of invention. His explanation is that the chance of someone creating an invention is roughly uniform across the population. As a result, the rate of inventing is higher in larger populations, and the cost of disseminating the invention is less for larger population groups. His model clearly falls apart about the time of the Industrial Revolution, which really should be called the Invention Revolution. Suddenly, a small population of English and then Americans start inventing at a much higher rate in proportion to their population than anywhere else in the world.

What was the rate of invention before the Industrial Revolution? The evidence is that new inventions before the Industrial Revolution increased in relation to the population but did not result in increases in per capita wealth. David Ricardo’s skepticism about inventions improving people’s lives appears to have been correct historically. The agricultural revolution increased human population, but people were still stuck in the Malthusian trap.

This graph is modified from a chart in, _Farewell to Alms, A Brief Economic History of the World,_ by Gregory Clark Princeton University Press 2007, p. 2.

This chart shows the income per capita from 1000 BC to approximately 2000 AD and is most representative of the US, England, and the West. It also presents one of the most important questions in economics: Why did real per capita income start to grow around 1800? It also begs the questions of why the Industrial Revolution started in England and the US and not elsewhere.

Until the Industrial Revolution around 1800, people were stuck in the Malthusian trap, which means they lived on the edge of starvation. We know that the only way for real per capita income to increase is for the level of technology to increase. Great Britain and the US have no one to acquire this technology from, so they suddenly had to increase the rate at which they invented. It is not surprising that Great Britain and the US had the only, or at least most effective, property rights in inventions and these legal systems were created or perfected around 1800. These property rights allowed per capita income to start growing exponentially. Note, this occurred with an exponentially growing population. Economic growth is due to inventions, and the advent of property rights in inventions spurred people to invent more, which resulted in the Industrial Revolution.[44](#sdfootnote44sym)

At the advent of the Industrial Revolution, France had a larger economy and a scientific community that was at least equal to England’s. William Rosen, in his book _The Most Powerful Idea in the World_, shows that it was England’s patent system that encouraged many of the English scientists to work on practical inventions and not just theoretical science; while in France, the scientific community shunned anything to do with commerce. As Rosen explains:

France and Britain: the former a national culture with a powerful affection for pure over applied knowledge, the latter the first nation on earth to give inventors the legally sanctioned right to exploit their ideas.[45](#sdfootnote45sym)

Rosen explains, “the Industrial Revolution was, first and foremost, a revolution in invention.”[46](#sdfootnote46sym) He has an interesting way of illustrating the dominance of English-speaking people living in countries with property rights for inventions in driving the Industrial Revolution. He points to a steam locomotive in the Science Museum in London known as the Rocket that was built in the 1820s to transport goods from Manchester to Liverpool. The Rocket incorporates hundreds of inventions, and if you could magically edit out all the inventions created in Italy, Sweden, France, or China, the Rocket would still run. If you did the same thing with the inventions created in England, Scotland, Wales, and America, the display would be empty.[47](#sdfootnote47sym)

Of course, Venice had a patent system, so why did the Industrial Revolution not begin there? Part of the answer is that Venice was too small, and their patent system did not cover a large enough market. The value of an invention is partly determined by the size of the market and the smaller the market, the fewer inventions in which it makes sense to invest. It also means you have fewer people, which means fewer potential inventors. Venice was just not large enough to achieve critical mass. However, it is important to note that Venice was incredibly wealthy by the standards of the day with some of the greatest inventors ever, including Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo, whom both took advantage of the Venice patent system. This was also the time of the Italian Renaissance. Another part of the answer is that Venice’s patent system was not built on a sound property system that applied to everyone.

Switzerland did not have a patent system until 1888 but was relatively wealthy. Switzerland was a relatively small market, and because the Swiss could avail themselves of other countries’ patent systems, they could free ride somewhat. However, there is evidence that the types of technologies the Swiss developed shifted from technologies that could be kept a trade secret to a broader class of technologies after the passage of their patent law.[48](#sdfootnote48sym)

The Japanese people were still stuck in the Malthusian trap in the 1880s, when Japan sent a delegation to examine other countries’ patent systems.

In 1886 Takahashi Korekiyo was sent on a mission to examine patent systems in Europe and the United States. The Japanese envoy was not favorably impressed with the European countries in this regard. Instead, he reported: “… we have looked about us to see what nations are the greatest, so that we could be like them; … and we said, `What is it that makes the United States such a great nation?’ and we investigated and we found it was patents, and we will have patents.” The first national patent statute in Japan was passed in 1888, and copied many features of the U.S. system, including the examination procedures.[49](#sdfootnote49sym)

In 1888, Japan passed a patent law that closely resembled the US’s. As the chart below shows, this is about the time Japan escaped the Malthusian trap. Note, this is also the case for China.

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu33757577_tmp_41c07843c95ec28e.png)

Since Japan was behind the US and Europe technologically in the 1880s, they could have just imported technology rather than create new technology to start the climb out of the Malthusian trap. Acquiring existing technologies can be accomplished just by freeing up capital investment rules without a patent system. This is clearly the case with China also. However, they both adopted a patent system as they embraced private property rights. This is logical since patents are private property rights for invention.

Having a patent system without having a system of private property does not make any sense. What would it mean to own your invention but not be able to own the physical embodiments of your invention? As a result, we would not expect any natural experiments on point. However, the Soviet Union, as was their tendency, tried the impossible; a patent system without property rights in general. What this meant in practice was a system of cash rewards to inventors. It was a disaster.[50](#sdfootnote50sym)

If Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong were on the above chart, they would start to escape the Malthusian trap about the time they adopted patent laws. Of course, as Paul Romer points out, all they needed to do to increase their per capita income dramatically was to adopt technology from the West. In fact, this is why less developed countries that are lower on the economic freedom scale are able to achieve higher growth rates than more advanced countries with higher economic freedom ratings. They can buy the latest technology and skip the steps in between. For instance, they do not need to start with an analog telephone system and switch operators. They can skip past early digital switches, analog cell phones, fiber optics with electronic repeaters, and go straight to a modern digital cellular phone system, with a modern optical amplified fiber optic backbone, thus, saving the cost and time that the creators of this system had to undergo.

The wealthiest, most inventive countries with the greatest dispersion of technology all have strong patent systems. If you look at the 2008 Index of Economic Freedom, the top five freest countries are Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland, Australia, and the United States. All of which have strong patent systems. The bottom five most repressive countries are Burma, Libya, Zimbabwe, Cuba, and North Korea, all of which have either the weakest or non-existent patent systems. All of these countries are still in the Malthusian trap, do not create new technologies, and have very little technology dispersion. If you group countries in quintiles of freedom, as the economic freedom index does, this trend would be true between each group. This lack of technology dispersion is inconsistent with Paul Romer’s idea that you want strong incentives to invent, but weak property rights for inventions for dissemination of new technologies. Since 2008, the USA has fallen significantly in economic freedom rankings and not surprisingly, its patent system has become significantly weaker.

A paper by the National University of Singapore shows a strong correlation between economic freedom and strong patent systems and economic growth.[51](#sdfootnote51sym) This correlation was strongest for the most economically advanced countries, but true across all countries.[52](#sdfootnote52sym) It is not surprising that less technologically advanced countries show a smaller correlation. These countries can grow based on importing technologies, and they can piggyback on the patent systems of the most advanced countries. However, if they fail to develop a culture of inventing, then they will eventually stagnate and always be one step behind the technological leaders.

The Bayh-Dole Act in the US presents an interesting natural experiment in patents and property rights. Before the act was passed in 1980, the US government owned 28,000 patents from publicly funded research. However, less than 5% of these were licensed, which roughly correlates with being commercialized.[53](#sdfootnote53sym) “The Bayh-Dole Act grew out of the Congress' efforts to respond to the economic malaise of the 1970s.”[54](#sdfootnote54sym) Before Bayh-Dole, “the government did not have a unified patent policy governing all the agencies that funded research, and the general policy was that government would retain title to inventions and would license them only nonexclusively.”[55](#sdfootnote55sym) Effectively, this meant that the inventions could not be owned, with the result that science research funded by the federal government, at the cost of billions of dollar, was just gathering dust.

The Bayh-Dole encouraged exclusive licensing[56](#sdfootnote56sym) of patents and technology developed with government funding. The results were that by 2008, there were about 35,000 patents licensed from publicly funded research.[57](#sdfootnote57sym) The _Economist_ stated:

Possibly the most inspired piece of legislation to be enacted in America over the past half-century was the Bayh-Dole act of 1980. Together with amendments in 1984 and augmentation in 1986, this unlocked all the inventions and discoveries that had been made in laboratories throughout the United States with the help of taxpayers' money. More than anything, this single policy measure helped to reverse America's precipitous slide into industrial irrelevance.[58](#sdfootnote58sym)

The Bayh-Dole Act shows that ownership of inventions is vital to their being disseminated, which completely contradicts Paul Romer’s thesis that patent rights inhibit the adoption of new technologies. The only potential caveat is that while it was the policy of federal agencies to license technology non-exclusively, even obtaining a non-exclusive license was often a bureaucratic nightmare.

The evidence from the Industrial Revolution and Bayh-Dole is that inventions are subject to a tragedy of the commons, not from overuse, but underinvestment. The evidence is overwhelming that inventions are exogenous. A number of economists have shown that inventors are motivated by financial return. For instance, Jacob Schmookler, in his book _Invention and Economic Growth_, shows that demand or expected return is the biggest factor affecting the number of inventions in a particular industry.[59](#sdfootnote59sym) His results were echoed by economic historian Zorina Khan.[60](#sdfootnote60sym) She provides extensive evidence that the US patent system and economic forces affect both the level and direction of invention. She shows that the US created the first modern patent system and the patent system provided the major incentive that caused the US to grow from an agrarian economy to a world economic and technology power in just 70 years.[61](#sdfootnote61sym) Note, there was very little government-sponsored research and development at the time.

The examples above show that patents, i.e., property rights for inventions, are a major incentive for inventors to invest more time and energy in creating inventions. It also shows that patents are effective at disseminating inventions. These examples also show that the creation and dissemination of inventions are critical to economic growth. In fact, there is no evidence that man would have escaped the Malthusian trap without property rights for inventions.

Despite this, many people argue that government funding for inventions is highly successful and better than a system of property rights for inventors. Academic economists often complain that patents lead to rent seeking and are monopolies, a subject we will discuss shortly. There are two fundamental flaws in their arguments. One is that patents are a property right and protection of property rights is not only necessary for economic growth, but also necessary for a just society. Second, the real rent seeking happens when governments attempt to fund R&D.

The advocates of this theory will point out that the American system of manufacturing was created, or at least advanced, when the government funded Eli Whitney to build ten thousand muskets, when the government funded the railroad network with the transcontinental railroad, when NASA created the electronics industry and jet aircraft. The forerunner of the Department of Energy created the nuclear power industry, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) created the Internet, and the Agriculture Department created ethanol fuels.

The transcontinental railroads were examples of the worst sort of crony capitalism, resulting in both railroads going bankrupt within ten years of the completion of the track. The track was poorly constructed.[62](#sdfootnote62sym) The government’s participation in energy technologies has been a disaster, from shale oil, to solar, to ethanol. Steven Mufson, in _Before Solyndra, a long history of failed government energy projects_ points out:

Not a single one of these much-ballyhooed initiatives is producing or saving a drop or a watt or a whiff of energy, but they have managed to burn through far more taxpayer money than the ill-fated Solyndra. An Energy Department report in 2008 estimated that the federal government had spent $172 billion since 1961 on basic research and the development of advanced energy technologies.[63](#sdfootnote63sym)

The electronics industry was built around computers, for accounting and other business tasks, and the consumer electronics industry. The Defense Departments and NASA merely piggybacked on these inventions. The groundbreaking inventions of integrated circuits, microcontrollers and microprocessors were created by private companies (Texas Instruments and Intel). Some of the early backbone behind the Internet might have been developed by the government, but the browser was a commercial invention. The Internet did not take off until the government got out of the way in the 1990s, and then the number of Internet-related inventions exploded and almost all of them were for and by the commercial sector.

Almost every major technological advance made in the US was due mainly to property rights provided by the patent system. These property rights made it possible to invest in creating and deploying these technologies. Without the patent system, these inventions would never have made it into the marketplace. Among these technologies are the telegraph, the telephone, the technology behind drilling for oil, the technology of cracking oil, the airplane, the copy machine, radio, television, the computer industry, the electronics industry, and yes, the Internet. The Patent Office is a totally self-funded agency, meaning it receives no federal tax dollars, which means the people of America and world have received this benefit without any cost to themselves. Direct government funding of R&D or cash prizes, as I called them, is fraught with rent seeking, waste and an abysmal failure.

If you look about your house and start to eliminate things that were subject to a patent, you will find that your house would not be standing today without those inventions. For instance, you are probably reading this on an electronic device. The plastic that makes the case was the subject of many patents, the steel was the subject of patents such as the Bessemer process, and the aluminum was the subject of many other patents. The electric device is made of transistors that were the subject of many patents, as were the integrated circuits, the microprocessor and the screen. You may be sitting in a chair using an electric light to read. The light bulb was the subject of numerous patents; the electrical generator that produces the power was the subject of numerous other patents, so they are all gone. The chair you are sitting in almost certainly has upholstery that was sewed together by machines and, therefore, the subject of hundreds of patents. Of course, if the fabric is a synthetic then it was the subject of patents, but even natural fibers were woven together using machines that were the subject of many patents. Even the glass in the windows you may be staring out of was the subject of many patents going all the way back to the Venice Patent Statute. The wood in your house was cut and planed with machines that were patented. The cement was the subject of other patents. Edison had a patent on a type of cement. In short, our modern world would not exist today without inventions that were the subject of patents.

  
  

## Chapter 7: Academic Arguments Against Patents

Despite the overwhelming evidence that patents drive the creation of inventions, which are the only way to increase real per capita income, a number of academic arguments have been advanced against patents. We cannot cover all the arguments, but most of them come in three varieties: 1) patents give monopoly power under the pure and perfect competition argument, 2) the tragedy of the anti-commons, and 3) patents are not legitimate property rights.

According to Wikipedia, “In economic theory, perfect competition (sometimes called pure competition) describes markets such that no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product.”[64](#sdfootnote64sym) The article goes on to define the characteristics of a perfectly competitive market as:

  
  

Generally, a perfectly competitive market exists when every participant is a "price taker,” and no participant influences the price of the product it buys or sells. Specific characteristics may include:

  
  

**A large number of buyers and sellers**—A large number of consumers with the willingness and ability to buy the product at a certain price, and a large number of producers with the willingness and ability to supply the product at a certain price.

**No barriers of entry and exit**—No entry and exit barriers makes it extremely easy to enter or exit a perfectly competitive market.

**Perfect factor mobility**—In the long run, factors of production are perfectly mobile, allowing free long-term adjustments to changing market conditions.

**Perfect information**—All consumers and producers are assumed to have perfect knowledge of price, utility, quality and production methods of products.

**Zero transaction costs**—Buyers and sellers do not incur costs in making an exchange of goods in a perfectly competitive market.

**Profit maximization**—Firms are assumed to sell where marginal costs meet marginal revenue, where the most profit is generated.

**Homogenous products—**The qualities and characteristics of a market good or service do not vary between different suppliers.

**Non-increasing returns to scale**—The lack of increasing returns to scale (or economies of scale) ensures that there will always be a sufficient number of firms in the industry.

**Property rights**—Well defined property rights determine what may be sold, as well as what rights are conferred on the buyer.

**Rational buyers**—buyers capable of making rational purchases based on information given

**No externalities**—costs or benefits of an activity do not affect third parties[65](#sdfootnote65sym)

Economists admit that almost no markets meet this definition; however, they argue, “perfect competition can be used as a yardstick to compare with other market structures because it displays high levels of economic efficiency.”[66](#sdfootnote66sym) Some economists have gone so far as to define capitalism as perfect competition. Under perfect competition, no producer can make an economic profit. They must sell their product at their marginal cost. Economists use this model to say any market that does not follow this is a monopolistic market or monopolistic competition, with monopolistic participants that are causing economic loss in the economy.

This book has shown that inventions are the only way to increase real per capita income, and patents are the key policy tool for unleashing inventors. How well does this fit with the perfect competition model? By definition, a new invention is unique and, therefore, does meet the perfect information or homogeneous product characteristics of perfect competition. Having a patent on the invention means the inventor has the right to exclude others from using their invention, so this does not meet the _no barriers to entry_ and may not meet the _large number of buyers and sellers_ characteristics. According to perfect competition, patents and inventions provide monopoly power and, therefore, are not economically efficient. The reality is that all property rights provide monopoly power under the theory of perfect competition, and some economists are honest enough to admit it. For instance, the grocer who owns the store on the corner of a busy intersection with good parking versus the grocer with a store on a dead end street with little traffic or the farmer who owns the most fertile land in the county versus the farmer who owns the least productive rocky land. In both of these cases, property rights will ensure that one person will have more power over the prices they can charge, which will give them more power over what they will pay for other goods. Perfect competition is completely incompatible with the conditions necessary for real per capita economic growth and is inconsistent with property rights, which Hernando de Soto and thousands of natural experiments have shown are key for maximizing the output of assets. It is confusing how economists can consider perfect competition economically efficient.

Let’s take a look at how this idea of “perfect competition” works out in our Robinson Crusoe economics. Now you might complain that “perfect competition” cannot be applied to a man on a deserted island since there are not numerous buyers and sellers, and there is no price. However, one of the key conclusions of “perfect competition” is that the price is equal to the marginal cost of production and there is a perfect analogy to this for our Robinson Crusoe. His marginal cost of production is the number of calories he expends in any activity, which must be equal to the number of calories consumed (or saved). In other words, Robinson is living on the edge of starvation, which in economic terms is the Malthusian trap. This means that if Robinson gets sick and cannot fish, hunt, or farm, then he will starve to death. Under perfect competition theory, Robinson will not be allowed to invent a net so his fishing will provide him with enough economic profit (surplus calories) to build a sturdy shelter, an irrigation ditch or a boat. What this shows is that economic profit is necessary for life. Every human requires so many calories a day, even resting. To stay alive, Robinson must produce more calories than this rest rate of burning calories, plus any additional calories he expends on his activities. The greater the number of excess calories he can produce, the more likely he will continue to live through sickness, drought, or natural catastrophe. Economic profit is necessary for life.

Perfect competition is supposed to be an ideal against which we measure other markets. However, it excludes the possibility of invention because they do not create a homogenous product. Some economists might argue this is not true. You can invent, but you must provide the information on how to make the invention to everyone simultaneously under the perfect information plank, which results in a homogenous product. This is Paul Romer’s position, and he preserves the ideal of perfect competition in his economic models. However, this book has shown that just creating inventions does not ensure their dissemination. There would be no reason for anyone to use the information to produce copies of the invention because they would not be allowed to make any economic profit, which means there is no reason to invest in an invention any more than any other investment. What is it called when a person cannot keep their inventions, and is not allowed to get a return on their efforts or a return on their knowledge? In other words, what is it called when a person does not own themselves and the product of their labor (mental and physical)?

Let’s examine how perfect competition would view the Industrial Revolution, the first time in history that large numbers of people escaped the Malthusian trap. The first person to invent a practical steam engine was Thomas Savery, in 1698 in England. Of course, inventions do not meet the _perfect information_ characteristic of perfect competition, so it fails the ideal. The first application for this steam engine was to pump water from mines. Savery patented his invention, which fails the no _barriers to entry or exit_ characteristic of perfect competition. Savery’s sales pitch to mine owners was that they would be able to remove water from their coal mines and, therefore, increase their return. This, of course, would fail the _no economic profit_ and the _homogenous product_ planks of perfect competition. However, it might be okay if Savery were to publish his work, under Paul Romer’s ideas. Nevertheless, the owners of the mine would need to invest money to install these devices, and they would not be allowed to earn an economic profit from this investment. Under perfect competition, Savery’s steam engine would never have been made or if made it would never have been deployed. If Savery’s device were never made, then the coal mines would have played out fairly quickly and more importantly, Thomas Newcomen would have never invented the first piston steam engine that would lead to the cheap power that drove the Industrial Revolution. In short, under perfect competition, the Industrial Revolution or Invention Revolution would never have happened, and we would still be living in the Malthusian trap.

Proponents of perfect completion say it results in allocative efficient markets. I am confused about what they mean by this. If we use perfect competition as our standard, we will drive humankind back into the Malthusian trap. This is like saying that India’s economy is more economically efficient than Singapore’s is because in India very few people are producing an economic profit compared to Singapore and very few people in India have any market power, while in Singapore, a large part of the population has market power. The measure of economic efficiency for Robinson Crusoe is the number of excess calories he is able to produce compared to the number of calories expended. In a macroeconomic sense, this means economic efficiency is the wealth created above the amount necessary for people in a country to subsist. In India, many people are living at or near the Malthusian trap, which is a very inefficient economy. While in Singapore, most people are making at least ten times the subsistence income level. Real economic efficiency would be the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) divided by the subsistence level in monetary terms.

Under perfect competition, people are not allowed to use their mind or at least to profit from their mind by inventing. It does not allow people to profit by making wise investment decisions or choosing a more profitable profession. Property rights are not allowed, and natural differences between people are not allowed. Think of the automatons in a gulag, such as Mao’s reeducation camps. Every person is treated exactly the same, and all are required to put out homogenous products. The perfect competition ideal is people living on the edge of starvation who are slaves. It is not a scientific theory; it is a moral theory, one that promotes slavery and death.

Under perfect competition, every property right, even property rights in yourself, are monopolies or provide monopoly power. This stretches the definition of monopoly to the point of nonsense and is inconsistent with the historical definition of monopoly. Now that we have dispensed with the perfect competition model as being a useful tool for determining what is a monopoly and what is a property right, we can examine whether patents are a monopoly on a rational basis.

According to Wikipedia, “In economics, a government-granted monopoly (also called a ‘de jure monopoly’) is a form of coercive monopoly by which a government grants exclusive privilege to a private individual or firm to be the sole provider of a good or service; potential competitors are excluded from the market by law, regulation, or other mechanisms of government enforcement.” Since patents are clearly “government granted,” then this is the appropriate definition. A patent gives the holder the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention (The US Patent Act, 35 USC 154). It does not give the holder the right to make, use, or sell their invention, so a patent holder has not been given a government grant to be “the sole provider of a good or service.”

There is a lot of nonsense in the economic profession about monopolies as shown above with respect to perfect competition. Even the definition above can lead to nonsense. For instance, according to Locke’s natural rights theory, you own yourself, so you own the product of your labor, both mental and physical. This means anything you produce you have the exclusive right to make and sell. Does this make you a monopolist?

The historical basis for monopolies is the Statute of Monopolies of 1623 in England. The Statute of Monopolies prohibited the Crown from issuing monopolies for items that were already known or being produced. The idea was to protect the natural rights of Englishmen to practice their craft. In today’s language, in issuing a monopoly, the government was interfering with private citizens’ rights to their property. However, the statute did not prevent an exclusive grant for inventions. The reason for this in the words of the day was an invention did not interfere with, or take away, anything from private citizens. The invention did not exist before it was invented, so it does not take away anything from private citizens to provide a limited term property right to the inventor. In other words, a monopoly is an edict by the government that infringes the property rights of others. The Statute of Monopolies was designed to be a limitation on the power of government.

Modern antitrust law has turned the concept of monopolies on its head. Instead of being a limitation on government power, like the Statute of Monopolies, it is a limitation on private action. Instead of protecting people’s rights to their property, like the Statute of Monopolies, it limits or takes away private property. The only logically consistent definition of a monopoly is an exclusive right to a market. No property right gives you an exclusive right to a market; it gives you the exclusive right to your property. Market success is not an exclusive right to a market. Only the government can create a monopoly.

American historian George H. Knight explained it this way:

How can the exclusive right of an invention be compared with a monopoly in trade? How can the exclusive privilege to sell salt in Elizabeth’s time, which added not one bushel to the production, but which enriched the monopolist and robbed the community, and the exclusive right of Whitney to his cotton gin, which has added hundreds of millions to the products and exports of the country, be both branded, with equal justice, with the odious name of monopoly?”[67](#sdfootnote67sym)

We have shown that using perfect competition to define a monopoly makes no sense. We have seen that, by the definition of a government granted monopoly, patents are not monopolies and modern anti-trust law has turned the rules against monopolies upside down. If patents were monopolies, then we should expect certain outcomes in markets that have patents. Specifically, patents should negatively affect the rate of creating new inventions and slow down the diffusion of inventions. If this thesis is correct, it should be testable. Let’s test this hypothesis. Below are the results that should occur if patents are a monopoly and what should occur if patents are a property right.

  
  

If MONOPOLY

1) Countries with strong patent systems should invent less than countries with weak patent systems.

2) Countries with strong patent systems should have slower dissemination of new technologies than those countries with weak patent systems.

  
  

If PROPERTY RIGHTS

1) Countries with the strongest patent systems should invent more than countries with weak patent systems.

2) Countries with strong patent systems should have faster dissemination of new technologies than those countries with weak patent systems.

  
  

Let’s examine the facts; according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the top ten most innovative countries and the bottom 10 countries for 2012 are:[68](#sdfootnote68sym)

If we examine the first postulate, does it appear the most inventive countries have the strongest patent systems or the weakest patent systems? Which countries have the strongest patent systems—the USA, Singapore, Switzerland or Niger, Pakistan, or Sudan? It is clear that the most inventive countries according to the WIPO survey also have the strongest patent systems. If we look at the charts from the National University of Singapore (NUS), we see those countries with the strongest patent systems are clearly the most inventive. Although the WIPO data and the NUS data are from different time frames, we see some overlap between those countries with the strongest patent systems (NUS) and the most inventive (WIPO) countries and the same is true for the countries with the weakest patent systems and least inventive countries.

Examining the second postulate, it is clear that those countries with the strongest patents have the most technology diffusion.

The macroeconomic evidence does not support the thesis that patents are a monopoly. The data shows the exact opposite of what this theory predicts. However it is consistent with the idea that patents are property rights.

  
  

## Chapter 8: Are Patents Property Rights?

Most economists take property rights as a given and do not examine their basis. There are three broad theories of property rights: 1) property rights are a fiction and do not exist (generally, these are Marxist), 2) utilitarian, and 3) natural rights. The utilitarian view of property rights is that they are socially useful tools for distributing scarce resources. The natural rights view of property rights is that people own themselves, so they own those things they create. Most economists seem to follow the utilitarian model of property rights, including Paul Romer.

We can dispense with the first theory that property rights do not or should not exist, as we have already shown that property rights are key to economic growth. Followers of the utilitarian model of property rights argue that ideas (inventions) are not subject to scarcity and, therefore, are not the proper subject of property rights. Tangible property rights include real property rights in land and buildings and personal property rights in things like cars and furniture. Tangible or physical property is scarce since it can only be owned by one person at a time, and it takes resources to create. Intangible or intellectual property such as patents and copyrights, and software, according to some, is not scarce according to this theory. Intangible property can be owned by multiple people without excluding others from the same property. According to Tom G. Palmer, a proponent of the scarcity theory of property:

It is this scarcity that gives rise to property rights. Intellectual property rights, however, do not rest on a natural scarcity of goods, but on an “artificial, self-created scarcity.”[70](#sdfootnote70sym)

How is property and how are property rights allocated under the utilitarian model? The logical answer appears to be in the way that provides the most social utility or eliminates the most scarcity. Are property rights, once allocated, fixed under the utilitarian model, or if better social utility can be achieved by reallocating property rights, is that allowed? Who gets to decide? This is not an academic question, as the US Supreme Court _Kelo v. City of New London_ shows. The town council of New London thought that they would receive more tax revenue if they could transfer the ownership of some land from homeowners to a large corporation. Their argument was that property rights are limited by social utility (i.e., tax revenue in this case) and they won. This brings up the question of whether you own yourself under the utilitarian model. What if better social utility could be had if you did not own yourself?

The natural rights basis for property rights starts with the axiom that you own yourself. If you do not own yourself, which includes the product of your efforts, you are a slave.[71](#sdfootnote71sym) If you own yourself, then you own your creations (physical and mental). Under the natural rights approach, it is clear why you own property.

Since you own yourself, you have the right to contract (i.e., enter into a legally binding agreement), which is how most people acquire property today. They trade their labor for currency. Then, they use the currency to buy food, cars, houses, etc. However, they still own those things they create; they just traded the product of their labor, under a contract, immediately to their employer in exchange for money.

The natural rights approach explains why slavery is illegal. If you own yourself, then no one else has the right to own you. It also explains why murder and manslaughter are illegal, why stealing is illegal, and why assault and battery are illegal; in fact, it explains most of our common law criminal law. Natural rights defines how property should be allocated and how people come into possession of property legally and morally. It explains all of our basic criminal law and all of our basic property laws. What does the utilitarian model of property rights explain? It offers no justification for why slavery, murder, manslaughter, assault, battery, and theft are immoral, except that they are inefficient at allocating resources. Thus, all of these crimes would be allowed if they were efficient at allocating resources. Scarcity does not explain who has ownership in property or why they should have ownership in property. It merely explains that private property ownership is an efficient manner of allocating scarce resources.

In science, the theory that has the greatest ability to explain the widest number of facts is considered the correct or better theory. Here, the utilitarian theory of property rights requires the additional assumption that it is preferable to have an efficient allocation of resources. However, it fails to explain how the resource should be initially distributed; it does not explain how property law determines ownership and has no power to explain criminal law. Trading the utilitarian concept of property for natural rights is like trading the theory that “what goes up must come down” for Newton’s law of gravity. The fact of the matter is that the proponents of scarcity have confused cause with effect. A system of private property results in efficient allocation of resources, but it is not the reason for private property—it is the effect of private property.

Other detractors state that it is absurd to think that patents are natural rights. Yet, the idea that patents are natural rights was stated explicitly by Sir William Blackstone as early as 1769. Locke’s ideas were incorporated into the law of the United States by William Blackstone’s _Commentaries on the Laws of England_. This treatise became the basis of common law in the US, and Blackstone is clear that inventors’ natural rights in property are founded on the same basis as all property rights.[72](#sdfootnote72sym) The idea that patents are a natural right is incorporated into early American law as this quote shows, “We protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests as much a man’s own, and as much the fruit of his honest industry, as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears” (Davoll v. Brown, 7 F. Cas. 197, 199 [C.C.D. Mass. 1845]). Natural law provides the clearly superior basis for property rights, and patents are a property right under natural rights.

Another academic attack on patents is based on the paper, _The Tragedy of the Anticommons._[73](#sdfootnote73sym) The title of this paper is a play on the classic economics problem where no one owns a resource so that it becomes overused, such as public grazing land. If a rancher uses grazing lands that he does not own, what is his incentive to use the land sparingly? If the rancher does not use the land extensively, another rancher may. The anticommons thesis is that if too many people share an ownership right in a resource, they will block each other from developing the resource. The paper applies the concept to many aspects of the economy. When it is applied to patents, it is generally referred to as a _patent thicket_. The argument being that too many patent holders will block each other’s ability to develop an area of technology. Anticommons proponents suggest that a patent thicket exists with respect to the software and biomedical industries. If a patent thicket existed in the biotech industry, we would expect a decrease in economic activity in the biotech industry as companies are locked out of the market. However, a study of the number of start-ups, venture capital funding, and number of product introductions in the biotech industry shows the exact opposite situation.[74](#sdfootnote74sym) If a study were done about the software industry in the 1980s and 1990s, when patent rights were being acknowledged in software, it would clearly show a major increase in economic activity in the software industry as evidenced by the number of start-ups, amount of venture capital invested, product introductions, and employment. There is also no macroeconomic evidence for this theory as has already been shown in this book. The empirical evidence does not support the patent thicket argument. Historical evidence of patents clogging up development is also lacking.

Several papers[75](#sdfootnote75sym) have pointed out that the anticommons argument for patents is based on flawed analogies. One common analogy for the anticommons problem is a river in which multiple entities charge a toll to pass. No one entity has an incentive to maximize the revenue from the total tolls collected, so they each attempt to maximize their toll price, which causes underutilization of the river. This example assumes a single starting point and a single ending point. However, the “geography” of the technology world is more complex because there are multiple ways to get from point A to point B. In fact, railroads, highways, and airplanes all represent ways around the toll problem on the river. As long as government does not put artificial limitations on these competing technologies, they will develop solutions that also encompass many more starting and ending points, which are more convenient for the customer and producer. Note that one of the goals of patent law is to develop these alternative solutions by encouraging designing around of patents.[76](#sdfootnote76sym) The _Tragedy of the Anticommons_ as applied to patents has no empirical support and is based on analogies that are logically flawed.

Perfect competition is a failed theory and should rightly be called Orwellian competition. Monopoly, properly defined, is government interference with property rights that gives an exclusive privilege to a market. Property rights cannot be monopolies. The best theory of property rights is natural rights. Patents are clearly property rights under this formulation.

  
  

## Chapter 9: The Study of Inventions, Inventors and the Inventing Process

Considering how important inventions are to economic growth, it is surprising how little they have been studied. One of the first people to study inventing systematically was the economic historian, Abbott Payson Usher, who cataloged his ideas in _The History of Mechanic Inventions,_ which was originally published in 1929.[77](#sdfootnote77sym) This book traces the history of inventions related to clocks, watches, printing, power, machine tools, and others. Based on this effort, Usher suggested that the creation of every invention follows a four-step process.

1. awareness of an unfulfilled need;

2. recognition of something contradictory or absent in existing attempts to meet the need, which Usher called an “incomplete pattern”;

3. an all-at-once insight about the pattern; and

4. a process of “critical revision” during which the insight is tested, refined and perfected.[78](#sdfootnote78sym)

I am not sure that the creation of every invention follows this process, but most do. For instance, I do not know what the unfulfilled need for the laser was. Generally, there may have been a small need for a coherent, monochromatic light source. However, the motivation for the laser seemed to be a desire to show that it was possible.

I also do not believe that every invention includes an “all-at-once” insight. It appears dangerously like the discredited “flash of genius” standard the Supreme Court announced in the _Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp_. 314 U.S. 84 (1941). The 1952 Patent Act explicitly rejected the “flash of genius” standard.[79](#sdfootnote79sym) Plenty of inventions are created by slow, deliberate work. Some inventions are created once the need is understood.

The process of inventing often is as much about knowing the history of technology in that area or a related area as about science and analytics. This is something that engineering schools should keep in mind. When the author was in engineering school, they focused almost exclusively on analysis. There has been some effort to correct this and the advent of inexpensive computers has helped engineering schools beef up their design classes. However, they still could add more courses on the history of technology as part of their curriculum. The best source for understanding the history of any modern technology is patents. All engineering and technology students should learn how to search patents and how to read them. Ideally, they should learn a little about patent law and the process of obtaining a patent.

The economist Jacob Schmookler undertook an econometric study of inventions in his classic book _Invention and Economic Growth.[80](#sdfootnote80sym)_ The opening line is “What laws govern the growth of man’s mastery over nature?”[81](#sdfootnote81sym) He examines a number of important questions in this area, including whether the creation of inventions is driven by the market or by scientific discovery. Is there a limit to the number of inventions that can be created? How many patents are commercialized? Are inventions inevitable?

One of the points Schmookler makes is that “society generally uses far more of its resources to disseminate technology than to advance it.”[82](#sdfootnote82sym) This is particularly relevant to the scarcity question about inventions. If dissemination is not free, as Paul Romer and others suggest, then property rights for inventions are critical for dissemination.

Schmookler’s book echoes many of the themes in this book. He states, “unfortunately, neoclassical as well as classical economics seems better adapted to the analysis of replication than to that of technological change.”[83](#sdfootnote83sym) By replication, Schmookler means an economy based on manufacturing (reproduction) that is technologically stagnant. The problem with this is “the vast economic changes since the Stone Age, or for that matter during recent centuries in the West, were possible only because of technological progress.”[84](#sdfootnote84sym) In other words, economics has failed to study the most important questions in economics.

Schmookler provides a slightly different definition of invention than this book:

Every invention is (a) a new combination of (b) pre-existing knowledge, which (c) satisfies some want.[85](#sdfootnote85sym)

This definition makes it clear that inventions are a combination of pre-existing knowledge and elements. Many people and judges (include those on the US Supreme Court) have tried to define an invention as something completely new. This we know to be impossible because inventions would then need to violate conservation of matter and energy. One problem with the above definition is that it does not differentiate art from invention. Paintings, songs, books, etc. are combinations of pre-existing knowledge that satisfies some want.

Schmookler makes an interesting analogy between inventions, genetics, and evolution. He explains inventions created today are based on knowledge and inventions produced earlier, which provides a genetic basis to invention. However, there is a huge selection process in which inventions go forward. “In the case of invention the selecting factor is man himself.”[86](#sdfootnote86sym) Because of this, inventing is “an economic choice made in the context of economic change.”[87](#sdfootnote87sym)

Most economists, according to Schmookler, assume that inventions are driven by scientific discoveries and, as a result, are noneconomic.[88](#sdfootnote88sym) He shows that inventors and inventions are influenced by economic interests much more than scientific discoveries. It should also be pointed out that the creation of many inventions preceded the underlying science. For instance, the steam engine preceded the science of thermodynamics and was a major impetus for its study.

The most important finding in the book according to Schmookler is the amount of inventive activity in an industry is directly related to the size of the market.[89](#sdfootnote89sym) This means that the process of inventing is largely an economic activity pursued for gain, and the expected gain is mainly determined by the size of the market to which the invention is directed.[90](#sdfootnote90sym)

B. Zorina Khan is an economic historian who has studied patents extensively. She has done yeoman’s work in cataloging the patent systems of US and Europe in the 19th century. However, there is more work to be done in this area. She is the author of the book, _The Democratization of Invention: Patents and Copyrights in American Economic Development, 1790-1920_.[91](#sdfootnote91sym) One of the points that Khan makes in this book is that the US in the 19th century was more concerned with protecting inventions and somewhat suspicious of protecting art. Europe in the 19th century was the exact opposite. Today it appears the US has followed the lead of Europe.

Ms. Kahn’s book provides extensive evidence that the US patent system and economic forces affect both the level and direction of invention. She explains that the U.S. created the first modern intellectual property system. This system is credited as a major factor in the U.S. becoming a technological leader in the world in less than 75 years. The U.S. patent system was so successful that it was widely copied by many European nations and Japan in the 19th century.

William Brian Arthur is another economist who has studied inventions, and he has an electrical engineering background. His book, _The Nature of Technology: What It Is and How It Evolves,[92](#sdfootnote92sym)_ points out that technology defines our standard of living. Increasing one’s level of technology is the only way to increase real per capita income. The book starts by defining a technology (invention) as a unique combination of elements and the author repeatedly points out that every technology is built on existing elements (technologies) and scientific phenomena. The problem with this definition is that it does not explain the difference between technology and art.

Arthur differentiates between standard engineering and invention. “Standard engineering, as I have defined it, deals with known technologies. This makes each design a new version—a new instance—of something already known.”[93](#sdfootnote93sym) He explains, “a change in principle then separates out invention—the process by which radically novel technologies arise—from standard engineering.”[94](#sdfootnote94sym) The problem with this definition is that it is not objective. What is a change in principle? All steam engines use the principle that a temperature difference can be used to do mechanical work. Does this mean that Newcomen’s steam engine is not an invention in light of Thomas Savery’s steam pump? Newcomen used a piston and, therefore, was able to pump water from deeper levels in coal mines, which was the first use of steam engines. Does this mean that James Watts’s steam engine that used a separate condenser and was more powerful than Newcomen’s is not an invention? How about the inventors who created high-pressure steam engines?

Arthur explains that a new system of technology (jet engines instead of prop engines) requires new component technologies. He has several interesting historical examples of this. The book shows that both technology and biological entities are built hierarchically, and higher levels of technology cannot be created until the building blocks are in place. The author explains that neither technology nor the economy is ever in equilibrium.[95](#sdfootnote95sym)

Arthur states, “I will define the economy as the set of arrangements and activities by which a society satisfies its needs (This makes economics the study of this.)”[96](#sdfootnote96sym) This is close to my definition. However, society does not have needs; people do. And society should be changed to people. This makes it clear that Robinson Crusoe economics applies.

Arthur lays out what he calls three fundamental principles. The first is “technologies are combinations.”[97](#sdfootnote97sym) The second is “each component of technology is itself in miniature a technology.”[98](#sdfootnote98sym) The third is “all technologies harness and exploit some effect or phenomenon, usually several.”[99](#sdfootnote99sym)

  
  

## Chapter 10: Natural Laws of Invention

Natural laws organize an area of knowledge and allow one to think conceptually about problems. Following and categorizing logical results have led to some of the greatest discoveries in science. I have found that inventions are bound by certain natural laws and some of these have been discussed above.

  
  

(1) Conservation Law of Invention:

  
  

_All inventions are combinations of existing/known elements._

  
  

This point has been made by Schmookler, Arthur and many others. Conservation of matter (and energy) means that you cannot create something from nothing. As a result, all inventions must be a combination of existing or known elements. By element, I do not mean chemical elements but that the parts that make up an invention at some level must have existed before. For instance, the first laser was a ruby rod laser, and its three major components were a ruby rod, a flash lamp, and a Fabry-Perot resonator (two parallel mirrors). All three of these things existed when the laser was invented. For those people who want to point to Americium (94), Curium (96), and Berkelium (97), all of these chemical elements are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons and all of these were existing elements.

Mr. Arthur is correct “all technologies harness and exploit some effect or phenomenon, usually several.” Inventions are not magic.

  
  

(2) Causality Law of Invention:

  
  

_Invention precedes production. Production precedes consumption._

  
  

This statement is true for every invention. In order to consume (use) an invention it first has to be invented and then produced. Very few of the things we consume or use are not inventions. Some of the exceptions include mother’s milk and air. This law explains why inventions define our standard of living and not production or consumption.

  
  

(3) Set Law of Invention:

  
  

_The number of potential inventions is infinite._

  
  

Every invention is a combination, and every invention can act as an element (component) for another invention. This means that the number of potential inventions grows combinatorially (N!). Of course, potential inventions are not actual inventions and not every combination will result in something useful. This does not absolutely prove that the number of inventions is infinite. However, for the number of potential inventions to be limited, there would need to be some reason why new inventions suddenly were not combinable with older inventions. In fact, the world has shown more interconnectedness between new technologies. For instance, electronics and the world of combustion engines used to be quite distinct, but now electronics have replaced mechanical carburetors and are now intimately intertwined in combustion engines.

Some people have suggested that the number of inventions is limited by the total mass and energy of the universe. First of all, the latest thinking in cosmology does not necessarily recognize a finite universe or finite mass and energy. Second, this would limit the implementation of all the inventions at once, but not necessarily the number of potential inventions.

This does not mean that inventions are inevitable. There have been cases where people have lost technologies, including medieval Europe’s loss of the knowledge of the invention of cement.

  
  

(4) Rate Law of Invention:

  
  

_The rate of invention is dependent on the number of inventors, the size of the set of elements (i.e., components, earlier inventions) the inventors can access, and the size of the set of goals._

  
  

Inventions are combinations of elements and connections, but an individual has to put together these combinations. If more individuals are involved in the process of trying out combinations, then there is a greater likelihood they will find a useful combination or invention. In a rough analogy, the more samples or children in a genetic algorithm, assuming they are diverse, the more likely or sooner you will find an acceptable solution. Individuals create these sample combinations and test them against selection criteria. If more people are creating these samples, then you increase your probability of inventing a useful product of service. The corollary is that you have more “failures” than you have successes.

A successful solution to a particular selection criteria or fitness criteria has an increased probability if the creators (inventors) have access to the complete set of elements available in the world. When the inventors are limited in their selection or application of existing elements, then it reduces the potential number of combinations. It is possible, in this case, that many solutions meeting the fitness criteria will not be part of the search space. This decreases the probability of finding a solution. When inventors’ freedom of action is restricted, it will decrease their chance of creating something useful.

Inventors as a group will be more successful if each individual inventor is allowed the freedom to pursue their own invention goal. There are at least two problems with restricting the goals of inventions. One, the individual’s talents and interests may fall into a forbidden area. Two, unexpected results may fall into a forbidden area and, therefore, not be pursued.

As a result, we see that freedom fosters invention. This is consistent with both our academic institutions’ policies and with capitalism (i.e., the economic system that is created when natural rights are protected by governments). Invention is not encouraged by plagiarism. Plagiarism results in wasted resources. This is one of the reasons for a patent system. We do not want people to plagiarize, but inventing around a patent, which creates a diversity of inventions, is good. The inventor is the first person to create a new technology because they add to the store of human knowledge. Even innocent copycats do not add to the store of human knowledge.

A corollary is that invention is fostered by wide dissemination of the information on how to build earlier inventions. Without this dissemination, individuals will waste time recreating technologies. This is why patent systems require a description of how to practice the invention.

However, this does not mean that just throwing people at the problem will work. In other words, the example of a 1000 monkeys typing on typewriters eventually will produce Romeo and Juliet. This combinatorial argument is false. It presumes the answer. Without the answer, there is no way to determine if you have created Romeo and Juliet. The same applies to software programs. Paul Romer has shown that the number of combinations for just a CD is virtually unlimited. The time to create a useful software program with random combinations is virtually infinite.

Reason and knowledge of science and technology are also keys to the success of inventors. Not all inventors are equal.

  
  

(5) Commons Law of Invention:

  
  

_Inventions are not subject to overuse. The creation of inventions is subject to underinvestment without property rights in inventions. The diffusion of inventions is subject to underinvestment without property rights in inventions._

  
  

Although there are an unlimited number of potential inventions, this does not mean that creating them is free. The U.S. spends over $300 billion per year on research and development to discover inventions.[100](#sdfootnote100sym) Just like real property, conceiving inventions takes scarce resources. The number of researchers, research facilities, and research equipment are all limited. Each researcher’s ability to pursue various inventions and discoveries is limited. It always costs less for a copier to produce existing items than to create their own inventions. This copying of inventions results in underinvestment in the creation of inventions.

Once an invention or discovery is made, it still costs considerable resources to distribute the invention. For instance, scientific principles are not subject to intellectual property rights and, therefore, can be freely disseminated. Despite this most people who learn science pay professors and others to teach them this freely availabl information. The U.S. spends over $500 billion per year on all forms of education. Adopting and distribution ideas, including inventions, is not free.

According to venture capitalists, most start-ups will spend 2-10 times the amount on marketing their inventions than on developing them. If the distribution of ideas were free, not subject to scarcity, this would clearly be unnecessary.

University professors, doctors, lawyers, engineers, judges, marketers, sales people, and computer scientists are mainly in the business of distributing or implementing known information. Most of these professionals would be unnecessary if distributing information was frictionless. Distributing information is extremely costly, especially new information.

Without property rights in inventions, most people and institutions will not spend the additional money required to create and distribute inventions. This results in underinvestment in creating inventions, which results in slower economic growth.

  
  

(6) Income Law of Inventions:

  
  

_The per capita income of a large group of people can only increase over the long term if their level of technology increases._

  
  

Real per capita increases in income can only result from new technologies. Adding capital (money or existing equipment) without any inventions associated with the capital will result in elevating every worker to a certain efficiency level, however, never above that level. Once every worker has all the capital resources that they can use in their job, they have hit a maximum output.

  
  

## Chapter 11: Accounting Rules Undercount Impact of Inventions

Accounting does not show any returns from inventions, but it does show the cost of creating those inventions. Research and development costs are immediately expensed. However, no asset is shown as being created as a result of these expenses. The assets that result from research and development are inventions protected by patents, trade secrets, and copyrights. Note, for something to be an asset, it must be owned by the entity. When a company makes a product that incorporates an invention, the accounting rules allocate all the profit to the manufacturing process and do not show any return on the invention. The one exception is for inventions that are licensed. In that case, the creator will show a return on the invention, and the licensee will show an expense. As a result, present accounting rules show inventing as an expense with no return. What hardheaded businessperson would invest in something that never showed a return?

As Nathan Myhrvold puts it, inventing is funded under a charity model.[101](#sdfootnote101sym) Governments and CEOs spend money in the hope that it will provide a return, but since they have no standard accounting mechanism for determining a return on this investment, it is just charity. This also causes companies to overvalue their manufacturing processes. Companies have no idea what their real return is on their manufacturing processes since they treat inventions as if they were free. As a result, these companies cannot make an intelligent decision concerning whether to manufacture a product using their inventions or whether they should license their technology to another entity.

For example, take a new cellular telephone that is the result of millions of dollars of investment in numerous inventions. Our accounting systems only allocate a return for the manufacturing of the phone and nothing for the inventions that made the phone possible. In the case of a new cellular telephone, most of the profit is due to the inventions, not to manufacturing. The retail value of the manufacturing of a cellular telephone is around the price of old technology cellular telephones, or presently $30 to $80, while new technology cellular phones cost $500 to $1000. The inventions are the reason for this difference in price.

These accounting errors contribute to the “not-invented-here” (NIH) problem. Since internally funded inventions appear to be free, externally purchased or licensed inventions look expensive in comparison. This causes reluctance on the part of many companies to license other entities’ technologies. This causes an underinvestment in inventions. Another problem that results from our flawed accounting systems is that brilliant engineers and scientists (inventors) are forced into management in order to obtain pay raises. Since our accounting systems show no value being derived from brilliant inventors, they are significantly underpaid. It is not surprising that many CEOs view the whole invention and patent process as just a tax necessary to enter a market without providing any real value. Is it any wonder that economists and business leaders do not understand the value of inventions and patents when our accounting system shows them as a cost without any return?

How do we fix our accounting systems, so they accurately reflect the value of investments in inventions? I am not an accountant; however, the basis of any solution should be to require a licensing fee from the manufacturing operation to the R&D operation for inventions incorporated into products. A sanity check on these valuations can be obtained by comparing the discounted cash flow value of these licenses to the company’s intangible assets value, as determined by the market value of the company. Most companies today have around 75% of their market value in intangible assets. These assets do not show up on a company’s balance sheet. That we accept a system not accounting for over half of companies’ value is gross negligence.

Modifying our accounting systems to track the value of inventions would show the value of these assets, result in them not being wasted, and increase investment in R&D. This would also provide a rational basis for a company to decide whether to use their inventions to manufacture a product, license the inventions to another entity, or purchase another entity’s technology. This would help eliminate the not-invented-here syndrome. It would also encourage active trading of inventions and additional investment in creating inventions. CEOs would then understand that investing in inventing is not charity, but key to their business success. Most importantly, we would all be wealthier since it would reduce underinvestment in inventions.[102](#sdfootnote102sym)

  
  

## Chapter 12: Entropy, Evolution, Economics

This book defines economics as the study of how people obtain those things they need to live. For example, Robinson Crusoe will burn 2000 calories per day doing nothing. This resting rate of burning calories we can consider to be entropy. Entropy was originally a concept from thermodynamics. One dictionary definition of entropy is that it is a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work. Here we are just using entropy to denote that every living being consumes energy that is not available for the organism to do useful work. We could just say that life requires energy without probably any loss of meaning. Failure to overcome this entropy results in the death of that organism. This means that life requires a profit in the sense that every organism has to acquire (produce) useful energy to overcome this entropy level. Robinson has to undertake activities that provide 2000 calories plus the calories necessary to undertake that activity just to break even. So we see life is a fight against entropy.

On a species level, life attempts to overcome entropy by adaptations that make it more successful at acquiring useful energy. The more successful the species is at acquiring useful energy, the greater its population will become, which will increase its chances of having offspring and useful adaptations. However, it will mean that the individuals in the species will also eventually begin to compete with each other for the resources that provide the energy to overcome the entropy. Because of population increases and using up the available energy, the species will be back at the point at which the calories it acquires are just on the edge of starvation, otherwise known as the Malthusian trap. Then, another adaptation of that species or another species will result in excess free energy, an increase in the population of that adapted species, and the process will repeat. There have been a number of proposals linking life, evolution, and entropy with varying success. An excellent paper describing these proposals is _Thermoeconomics: Beyond the Second Law, Journal of Bioeconomics_, by Peter Corning.[103](#sdfootnote103sym) The connection proposed by this book is fairly modest.

Humans, unlike other animals, alter their environment to obtain useful energy rather than waiting for genetic changes to make their physiology better adapted to the environment. The way humans do this is by creating things, i.e., inventing. One of the greatest inventions, actually thousands of inventions, was agriculture. This caused the human population to expand enormously, just as we would expect from evolution.

Agriculture seems to have arisen in the fertile crescent in the Middle East roughly 10,000 years ago. It started spreading about 9,000 years ago, taking about 4,000 years to spread to the northern and western fringes of Europe–Scandinavia, England and Spain–thus moving at about 1 kilometer a year. This transition was associated with a sharp rise in population.[104](#sdfootnote104sym)

Unfortunately, this invention or series of inventions (adaptations) did not result in an escape from the Malthusian trap as we have seen. This is exactly what David Ricardo predicted. New inventions would provide a lift to the standard of living for a while until the population increased and drove people back into the Malthusian trap. However, it does demonstrate the connections between economics and evolution. Inventions are the equivalent of adaptions from a survival point of view. In fact, the study of economics would be the same as the study of the evolution of humans, if humans were not rational animals that invent. Ray Kurzweil makes a similar point.

According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of evolution, more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (intentionally to design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency.[105](#sdfootnote105sym)

Despite this, it was not until the Industrial Revolution that humans began to invent (adapt) fast enough to overcome population growth and diminishing returns.

I am going to make conjecture that the law of diminishing returns is related to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in any isolated system entropy (energy not available to do useful work) never decreases. This is the reason it is impossible to build a perpetual motion machine. Of course, the Earth is not an isolated system. For instance, it receives tremendous amounts of energy from the Sun that can be used to reduce the entropy on Earth. Diminishing returns is the decrease in the marginal (incremental) output of a production process as the amount of a single factor of production is incrementally increased, while the amounts of all other factors of production stay constant.[106](#sdfootnote106sym) The common example is that if a farmer starts using fertilizer he will increase his output. But as he increases the amount of fertilizer he uses the increase in output will decrease per unit of additional fertilizer. If the farmer adds too much fertilizer, it will actually result in a decrease in production. “Classical economists such as Malthus and Ricardo attributed the successive diminishment of output to the decreasing quality of the inputs. Neoclassical economists assume that each ‘unit’ of labor is identical. Diminishing returns are due to the disruption of the entire productive process as additional units of labor are added to a fixed amount of capital.”[107](#sdfootnote107sym) The classical economists’ formulation is closer to what I am driving at. For instance, when agriculture was invented the first time a farmer planted on the land it was very fertile. However, successive plantings on the same soil resulted in less output because nutrients in the soil were depleted. On a species level, as the population grew due to agriculture, people were forced to farm land that was less fertile. In both cases, the quality of the inputs decreased.

The second law of thermodynamics is often described as the “arrow of time.” This is usually explained by example. For instance, if you drop a glass on a tile floor it breaks. However, you never see the reverse where shards of glass jump together from a floor to form a glass that then lands on the table. With energy, we can lower the entropy level, but usually it is not a direct reversal of the process. For instance, we can grind up the glass and use it as feedstock for a new glass, and this reduces the entropy, but it is not a reversal of the arrow of time. What this means is that processes tend to create waste products, and the supply of inputs become more scarce (lower quality). This results in diminishing returns on a macro scale for any process and applies to biological processes. For instance, yeast, when used to create wine or spirits, will either run out of sugar or produce so much alcohol they die.

Many of the biggest policy debates today are animated by this phenomenon. This debate takes the form of we are either going to run out of resources, or we are going to create too much waste (pollution). Proposed solutions include conservation and sustainability. Conservation is not really a solution; it is an attempt to slow the process. Sustainability is an attempt to overcome, or at least manage, diminishing returns. There are numerous and conflicting definitions of what sustainability means. However, most sources point to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), also known as the Brundtland Report. According to the 1987 Brundtland Report, sustainability is: "Meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs." This definition is not testable and is incredibly vague. What are the “needs” of the present generation? Do we need the Internet, satellites, SUVs, etc.? How do we know if this will compromise future generations’ ability to meet their needs?

Since this is not a productive path of inquiry, let’s take the word “sustainable” literally. A sustainable technology would be one that can be used indefinitely by humans without side effects and without any diminution in its effectiveness. It is clear from the discussion above this violates the second law of thermodynamics. Any use of technology at least produces waste heat—a side effect. Sustainability, taken literally, is an attempt to create a perpetual motion machine. Even the Sun’s energy will not last forever; it is not infinite. Is the sustainability movement unrealistically optimistic?

A key issue for the sustainability movement is the use of so-called non-renewable resources, such as the use of fossil fuels and the using up of other natural resources (diminishing returns). The way this is often phrased today is peak oil, peak water, peak (pick your favorite resource). Peak oil occurs when the amount of oil that can be extracted reaches its maximum or the point at which we reach the maximum net energy output from oil. The alternative definition takes into account that even if we can extract more oil, this is irrelevant if it takes more energy to extract the oil than we receive from the oil. The supposed solution to our peak oil problem is to develop renewable energy resources. The Clean Energy Initiative website provides the following definition “Renewable energy is natural energy, which does not have a limited supply. Renewable energy can be used over and over again, and will never run out.”[108](#sdfootnote108sym) What is a natural energy? Either all energy is natural, comes from nature, or only animal muscle power is natural. The natural qualification is complete nonsense—unless they really want us to go back to animal muscle only. The “never run out” qualification violates entropy. All energy resources will run out. All energy sources, fossil fuels, solar, hydroelectric, tidal, biomass, hydrothermal, fission, fusion, etc. are solar or at least stellar. For instance, hydroelectric energy is the result of the Sun heating the oceans or other large bodies of water. As the water evaporates and then condenses in the form of rain or snow on landmasses, it is collected in dams. The dams convert the gravitation force of the water into electric energy. Fossil fuels are created by plants converting sunlight into biomass. The biomass is trapped underground by sea sediment, and the pressure and heat convert the biomass into oil, coal, natural gas, etc.[109](#sdfootnote109sym) Fission is the process whereby heavy elements, generally Uranium, are split into lighter elements and energy is released. These heavy elements were created in a star that has long since expired. Thus, all energy is solar or, at least, stellar. The Sun will not last forever and does not provide unlimited energy. The concept of renewable energy that “will never run out” and “can be used over and over again” is untenable. So was Malthus correct? Are humans doomed by entropy to eventually return to the Malthusian trap or worse? Is the defining characteristic of economics that diminishing returns (entropy) will always force humans back to the point that we are on the edge of starvation?

This concept of peak resources is not new. You can find numerous examples similar to peak oil historically. For instance, the fertilizer crisis of the 19th century. In 1830, it was discovered that bat guano was an excellent fertilizer. The population exploded, as guano was used in Europe. The best sources of guano began to run out fairly quickly. People predicted the equivalent of peak guano. However, the real question was not whether we would have peak guano, but peak fertilizer. In other words, we did not have a guano problem; we had an invention problem. The Haber-Bosch process was invented in 1909, which allowed fixing nitrogen in air and solved the peak guano problem.[110](#sdfootnote110sym)

_Reason_ magazine, in the article “Peak Everything?”, discussed how logical, scientific projections showed we would run out of lithium, neodymium, and phosphorus.[111](#sdfootnote111sym) Peak lithium was going to limit the batteries necessary for electric cars. In fact, we would run out of lithium faster than we would run out of oil. The solution is a new invention that replaces lithium with zinc air batteries. Note, the solution was not a better way to extract lithium, but to make the supply of lithium irrelevant. New inventions can create paradigm shifts. Peak neodymium is going to limit our ability to build the electric motors of hybrid cars, as well as other products. Interestingly, neodymium magnets were invented to overcome the problem of peak cobalt. In the area of permanent magnets, it appears that a new induction motor will eliminate the need for permanent magnets. Peak phosphorous is a repeat of peak guano. Peak phosphorous threatens our ability to provide enough fertilizer for our agricultural needs. One solution is to exploit human waste. Phosphorous is a byproduct of human urine. The phosphorous can be recycled using a no-mix toilet.

The computer industry has also been beset by predictions of impending doom, when it could no longer achieve Moore’s law of doubling the number of transistors every eighteen months. Ray Kurzweil has shown that if you restate Moore’s law as computational power, every time a technology reaches its limit to improve computational power, a new technology takes over. Using this, he shows that computational power has been growing exponentially since 1900. The first computational devices were electromechanical. When these devices reached their limit, they were replaced with relay devices; these were replaced with vacuum tubes, then transistors, and finally integrated circuits.[112](#sdfootnote112sym) However, if you trace the speed of machines beginning with the invention of the steam engine, it peaks at around supersonic flight. It is difficult to determine if this is an economic/technological limitation or a political limitation.

Diminishing returns are the result of the arrow of time part of the second law of thermodynamics that results in lower quality inputs and more waste outputs. These issues can be modeled as a decaying exponential in production in a technologically static environment. This is illustrated by looking at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The first coal was easy to extract. The coal was near the surface. As people mined the coal, the mines got deeper making it harder and more costly to extract. But more importantly, at some point the mines would fill up with water. Extracting this water by hand in buckets was expensive and time-consuming. The quality of the inputs, coal or coal mines, was lower, which resulted in diminishing returns for mining coal without new inventions. And that is where the steam engine came in.

  
  

## Chapter 13: Are Inventions Subject to Diminishing Returns?

Every invention is a combination of known elements. As a result, every invention opens the possibility of more inventions by building on earlier inventions, which was explained in the set law of inventions. Creating these inventions takes energy, but the number of potential inventions we can conceive of increases with every invention we create. As a result, the number of potential inventions grows factorially. There are four ways in which inventions could be subject to diminishing returns: 1) the total number of inventions are limited, 2) the inventions in a narrow area of technology are limited 3) the returns on devoting more resources, as a percentage of total resources, to inventing declines, and 4) the cost of creating the next invention in any technology could increase compared to its return.

We have shown in the set law of inventions that the number of potential inventions is not limited, and it is very unlikely that there are limits to the number of actual inventions.

Inventions in a narrow area of technology are likely subject to diminishing returns. Ray Kurzweil has studied this and found that new technologies appear to follow an S-curve with the greatest return in the middle of the S and eventually declining in return.[113](#sdfootnote113sym) Jacob Schmookler also noticed this. Cross-pollination between the primary area of technology and other areas of technology appears to prevent diminishing returns in a narrow area of technology, similar to how substitute resources prevent diminishing returns for natural resources.[114](#sdfootnote114sym)

If a greater and greater percentage of a country’s, or the world’s, resources were devoted to discovering inventions, would it hit a point of diminishing returns? No country has ever come close to testing this hypothesis. Countries throughout history have underinvested in inventions and provided little or no incentive for inventors. Those countries that have devoted the most resources to inventing have seen the greatest economic returns. The U.S. has historically devoted the most resources to invention. It has historically had the strongest laws protecting the rights to inventions, which has resulted in greater resources being devoted to invention. England had some of the strongest laws protecting inventors at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and it was the hotbed of invention at that time. There is a minimum amount of resources that must be devoted in a country to agriculture, manufacturing, and maintenance. If inventive activity were so large as to crowd out those activities, then the world might hit a point of diminishing returns for inventing.

The idea that the cost per invention could increase to the point of diminishing returns seems to have credence if we look at a narrow technological area. For instance, the cost of improving the aerodynamics of airplanes is extraordinarily expensive. However, modern electronics allow us to improve the aerodynamics of planes by putting in control systems that allow a plane to be unstable aerodynamically. Commercial supersonic flight was not feasible economically in the 1970s because of aerodynamic drag. This problem can be solved today fairly inexpensively with electronic control systems. The cost of inventing in electronics grew tremendously with the advent of the integrated circuit. However, the advent of personal computers and software has driven down the cost of inventing in electronics and a wide variety of other areas. There is evidence that the cost of inventing is decreasing over time if we do not limit inventing to a narrow area of technology.

Diminishing returns can be modeled as a decaying exponential as explained above. In a technologically stagnant society, entropy or diminishing returns will prevail. Inventing is the key to escaping the Malthusian trap and growing real per capita income. Inventions across all areas of technology are not subject to diminishing returns. Potential inventions grow factorially, which is much faster than diminishing returns shrink. Thus, it is entirely possible to grow our technology faster than the limitations of diminishing returns and the second law of thermodynamics. However, it is not foreordained that humans will invent. Humans are volitional beings, and they can choose not to invent. Systems that protect inventors’ rights to their inventions are key to ensuring we invent faster than entropy erodes our ability to produce.

  
  

## Chapter 14: Intellectual Capitalism

_Unfortunately, neoclassical as well as classical economics seems better adapted to the analysis of replication than to that of technological change. The vast economic changes since the Stone Age, or for that matter during recent centuries in the West, were possible only because of technological progress._

—Jacob Schmookler

  
  

This chapter integrates this information into the foundations of an economic school of thought. I will discuss not only the major tenants, but also some of those concepts from other areas of economics that are not part of intellectual capitalism. Marx was the person who coined the term capitalism and like so many things, he got it wrong. In fairness to Marx, most of the classical economists placed their emphasis on the creation of capital as the key to understanding the economy also.

All capital is intellectual capital. Humans are rational animals[115](#sdfootnote115sym) and use this ability to think, to create inventions that alter their environment in a way that improves the chances of their survival. The source of savings that can be used as capital is invention that provides a profit. Classical economics confused the cause with the effect and assumed that the source of inventions was capital. The most important input to an economy is its inventions or the minds of humans.

Increasing the level of technology is the only way to increase real per capita income or wealth of large groups of people. The only long-term way to increase the level of technology is to create new inventions. An invention is a human creation with an objective result. There are a number of natural laws of inventions. For instance, an invention is always a combination of existing and known elements; an invention uses and obeys natural phenomena and/or laws; and usually builds on earlier inventions. Invention precedes production and production precedes consumption. The natural laws of invention show that the rate at which inventions are created is related to how free people are and aligns itself with policies based on natural rights.

This book defines economics as the study of how people obtain the things they need to survive. There is no distinction between mere survival and thriving. The idea that because you have enough food for a day, or a week or a year, that economics is not about survival is short sighted. All the evidence shows that one’s standard of living is related to how long one will survive. This is partly because almost no one has everything they will need to live forever. For instance, think of all the food, medical care, shelter etc., you will need for the rest of your life. This amount of resources exceeds all but less than one percent of the people in the world. Also, one’s standard of living determines one’s chances of surviving natural disasters, illness, and other disruptions.

This definition of economics makes it clear that economics applies to Robinson Crusoe (a person on a deserted island). When we look at Robinson, we see that profit is necessary for him to sustain his life. A number of errors in economics are immediately apparent when using Robinson Crusoe economics. For instance, the idea that increasing the money supply results in economic growth. Increasing the money supply is a nice way of saying counterfeiting. If Robinson prints money, he still has exactly the same resources (less some paper and ink) and the same needs he had before, except he has wasted calories (his currency) on this activity.

Patents, which are property rights for inventions, are the single most important policy for increasing real per capita income. Patents cannot exist in a vacuum; they are part of a system of property rights. The only valid conceptual framework for property rights is natural rights. Natural rights, updated for modern language, is the logical system that evolves from the fact that you own yourself. This logical system can be almost as precise as Euclidean geometry. The logical system of natural rights explains almost all of our property laws, our contract laws, and common law criminal laws.

The advent of the modern patent system corresponded with, and was the reason for, the escape from the Malthusian trap by large numbers of people. The first modern patent system was created in the United States; however, Great Britain had a patent system that was somewhat effective before the United States. Many countries in Europe and throughout the world copied the United States’ patent system in the 19th century.

Technologically backward countries can increase their level of technology without creating new inventions. Thus, patent systems are less important to them. What they need are rules that allow the free flow of capital and people to acquire existing technologies. However, a rational patent system would not be country specific. It would be absurd if when I drive into Canada from the United States I lose the right to my car. I do not lose the copyright to my book, but I lose the patent right to my invention.

The present patent system in the United States and most of the world has been perverted into a crony system designed to favor large corporations and the politically connected. Aside from a worldwide patent, a rational patent system would start with the proper definition of an invention. Our present laws confuse what an invention is, with who is the inventor among other problems. There is not space in the book to explain all the problems or fixes to our present patent system, but it would start by properly defining what an invention is and who is an inventor. For more information, see the appendix on how to fix the patent system.

A big part of the misunderstanding of patents among economists is the failed concept of perfect competition. Capitalism is not perfect competition. Perfect competition leads to wealth destruction and falling back into the Malthusian trap. Perfect competition cannot differentiate between a property right and government granted monopoly. Perfect competition requires the elimination of the human mind from the market. It is not surprising that the analysis of patents fares poorly under perfect competition. The Industrial Revolution would never have happened if government policies in the United States and Great Britain were geared to ensure perfect competition. If you eliminate every product in your house or office that was subject to a patent or made by a patented process, your house or office would not be standing. Patents have been instrumental in defining our modern world.

Proponents of perfect competition suggest it promotes allocative efficiency. There is no evidence for this. The efficiency of an economy is the median income divided by a subsistence wage. The most efficient economies are those with the most technology, the most patents, and the most people producing unique products. Capitalism and income growth are not about competition; they are about invention. To the extent we want people competing, we want them competing to produce new inventions and products based on these inventions.

Antitrust laws based on perfect competition have inhibited the development of systems to transfer patent rights efficiently. Governments have used antitrust laws to attack patent licensing generally, such as the nine no-nos of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States in the 1970s, but also organizations to hold patents that collect and distribute royalties. This topic diverges too much from the main thrust of this book to be discussed in detail. Antitrust policies have inhibited the development of new inventions and a market for the profession of inventing.

Our accounting systems fail to account in our businesses or in the economy for the value of inventions. They allocate all of the returns from inventions to the manufacturing process. This has resulted in overvaluing manufacturing and undervaluing inventions. As Nathan Myhrvold says, inventions are funded under a charity model today.

A fundamental concept of economics is diminishing returns. The book shows that this is related to the concept of entropy. All life, not just human, is in some sense a struggle to overcome the entropy law. Until Homo sapiens came along, the way life overcame this was through genetic evolution. Humans alter their environments, unlike any other lifeform, to suit their needs. The way humans do this is by inventing things, such as shelter, spears, nets, etc. If humans did not invent, then the study of economics would be the same thing as studying the evolution of Homo sapiens.

Because of entropy or diminishing returns, a technologically stagnant economy will regress to the Malthusian trap or stay stuck in it. Inventions across all technologies are not subject to diminishing returns. Diminishing returns result in an exponential decay, whereas possible inventions grow factorially and are infinite. As a result, the way to overcome diminishing returns or entropy is to have policies that encourage inventing, which includes patents and those policies consistent with natural rights. The United States, not surprisingly, was founded on natural rights. The principles of natural rights are the foundation of our Declaration of Independence, but also underlie our common law. William Blackstone’s _Commentaries_ formed the basis of common law in the United States and his analysis was based on Locke’s natural rights. For the same reason, natural rights form the basis of most common law countries.

Real environmental concerns cannot be solved by sustainability or conservation; they can only be solved by inventions. The countries that pollute the least are those that are the most technologically advanced. Inventions are often directed at using these waste products. For instance, oil was something undesirable to have on your land in the early 1800s; it made your land not arable. Then, with the advent of methods of refining crude oil, it became valuable and saved the whales from being wiped off the face of the earth. When I was a kid, natural gas was considered a waste product by refineries and they always had a torch burning off its excess. Today, it is a highly valuable commodity.[116](#sdfootnote116sym)

In any free market or market areas, the cost of products will decline over time, or the capabilities will increase for the same price. The electronics industry is the poster child for this, but this can also be seen across the whole economy in the United States during the late 1800s. The two things that stop this process are regulations (rules that are preemptive in nature or inconsistent with natural rights) and inflation. One example of regulation in the United States driving up prices is building codes and zoning laws. These rules have killed off new inventions in the building industry. They have also entrenched building practices from the 1960s and 1970s and entrenched the large companies that provide the products for this technology. People in the United States think it is natural that the prices of their homes should appreciate. In fact, they are convinced that houses are an investment because of these policies, instead of a depreciating asset. They believe rising prices for homes is a good thing. This is not true for any other products or services. The American people have been duped on this issue.

The introduction of money or currency often leads to nonsense in economic thinking. For instance, the multiplier effect explains that if the government spends X amount of money then the economy grows by 3X, and if a private sector actor spends X, then the economy grows by 4X. The reasoning for this is that the person who receives the money, then goes out and spends some of that money with other people and so on. If this were true, we could be infinitely rich by just having the government spend an infinite amount of money. Even the most adamant Keynesians had to abandon the 3X multiplier, but now they talk about multipliers of 1.15X. However, the absurdity of the situation is the same, with infinite spending causing infinite wealth. Beyond that, if you trade a gallon of milk for a dozen eggs, how can that possibly result in a 4X increase in the economy? If your production of milk does not increase and neither does the person raising eggs, then there is no change in the economy. We know that the only way to increase real per capita GDP is by increasing your level of technology, which ultimately means creating new inventions.

There is a lot of confusion about central banks (the Federal Reserve in the United States), fractional reserve banking, and legal tender laws. The discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this book. Suffice it to say that manipulating the money supply cannot cause real per capita increases in income or wealth and even sound money by itself does not create wealth; it just keeps it from being destroyed.

Intellectual capitalism is founded on the unique nature of human beings, which is that we are capable of reasoning. Resources are not given to humans. They must acquire them with their own efforts. Humans are capable of altering their environment unlike any other living organism, and they do this by creating inventions, which are the ultimate source of economic growth.

  
  

## Chapter 15: Interview with the Future

This is a fictional interview with a Mr. Farnsworth from the future. It is set fifty years after the ideas of this book have been incorporated into the laws and policies of governments.

  
  

Interviewer: Mr. Farnsworth, have the people of the United States, or more generally the world, experienced economic growth as a result of these ideas?

Farnsworth: Absolutely.

Interviewer: Care to elaborate?

Farnsworth: We are experiencing growth rates of your Asian tigers. In fact, we are finding that Ray Kurzweil is right, and our growth rates are accelerating.

Interviewer: You must have huge manufacturing companies.

Farnsworth: Actually no. Most manufacturing is done on site with advanced versions of what you called 3D printers. Of course, there are companies producing the feedstocks for these personal manufacturing devices, but they are small by the standards of your day. It turns out that large manufacturing companies were the Luddites of the 21st century.

Interviewer: How so?

Farnsworth: Well, they argued that all wealth came from manufacturing and in an attempt to protect their markets, they attacked the profession of inventing. Eventually, reason and 3D printing won the day.

Interviewer: What about farming and the food companies?

Farnsworth: Food is now 3D printed in the home or restaurant. Some farms are kept alive as museums. It took a while for people to get used to printed food, but creative chefs began making all sorts of interesting flavors, and this caused acceptance to grow. Imagine being able to define exactly the marbling and type of steak, cooked exactly as you like it.

Interviewer: So if the manufacturing and the food sectors do not employee many people, where do people work?

Farnsworth: Most people work for themselves. They combine together in small teams to take on projects. When the project is over, they form up in new teams to take on new projects, sort of like a pickup game of basketball. About 50% of the population works in the creative fields of inventing and art. For instance, an inventor or inventor team creates all the products we produce in our personal manufacturing devices. They receive a fee or royalty for each instance of the device that is realized.

Interviewer: That must be a very difficult way to make a living. I mean royalty rates can only be a small part of the overall cost.

Farnsworth: Actually, most of the cost of producing anything is this fee that goes to the inventors or artists, often 70% or more. The value added is not in the manufacturing but in the design.

Interviewer: It must be hard to clear all the overlapping IP rights. There must be a huge number of patent lawsuits.

Farnsworth: There are companies that specialize in clearing IP rights, sort of like your American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers except that they cover inventions. Working for one of these companies is considered a great place for a budding inventor to work as is the Patent Office. Once the nonsense of antitrust laws was removed, the market quickly created a system for clearing patent rights inexpensively and efficiently. Of course, that does not mean there are no patent lawsuits, but they are the exception.

Interviewer: So who are the wealthiest people in your society? Is it Wall Street financiers? Lawyers? Doctors?

Farnsworth: (laughs) I almost forgot about Wall Street. Once the financial regulations were lifted, Wall Street disappeared.

Interviewer: But investment bankers are still the kingpins of industry?

Farnsworth: No. First of all, the large amounts of capital that were required for the enterprises of an industrial enterprise are no longer necessary. Second, people are no longer required to use bankers to jump through regulatory hoops to raise capital. Most capital is raised through informal networks. The people providing capital compete to fund projects, particularly inventions. In our world, it is the financiers who scramble and pitch inventors. It is understood in my world that the real value created in this world is by the talent.

Interviewer: What about lawyers then?

Farnsworth: Being an attorney is considered a respectable, middle-class job. But it is not considered glamorous or a way to become wealthy. It is usually the sort of job someone who is not ambitious or only moderately talented would select. With the stability in our laws, the so-called creativity of lawyers of your day no longer exists. Being a patent attorney is considered a good profession for a budding inventor, however.

Interviewer: As wealthy as your country is, your politicians must be very powerful and important.

Farnsworth: Politicians are considered caretakers, minor functionaries, sort of like hiring a gardener or property manager. If you think about it, most of what politicians do or should do is a caretaking sort of position.

Interviewer: But the politicians control the laws and how the nation’s tax dollars are spent.

Farnsworth: The scope of actions that politicians can take in my world is very limited. The total cost of all government is less than 3% of GDP. This may sound fantastic to you, but this was also true during the first 100 or so years of the United States and many other countries at that time. We do not allow the freewheeling, politician-serving projects you allow. Any politician or bureaucrat who oversteps their bounds is swiftly rebuffed by the nearest private citizen. Private citizens are above the politicians. Very few people pay attention to politicians unless they attempt to violate the scope of their duties. I doubt if half the people know the president’s name.

Interviewer: Who are the wealthiest people in your world?

Farnsworth: Inventors. Because of the tremendous growth in the economy, the wealthiest people today are very rarely the wealthiest people in a couple of years. Successful artists also become very wealthy but are not in the same class as inventors.

Interviewer: What about sports stars?

Farnsworth: They do very well, but not as well as artists do. There is not a single person on the Forbes 400 who made or inherited their wealth from manufacturing, distribution, finance, or the extraction industries in my world.

Interviewer: What about the poor? I mean there must be huge income gaps. Housing must be very expensive.

Farnsworth: No one is truly poor unless they were born with very limited mental abilities and have no family or have alienated everyone in their life. Housing is a very small part of anyone’s budget in my world. New inventions drove the price of housing down mercilessly.

Interviewer: What about medical care and extended illnesses? I mean, medical care can be very expensive.

Farnsworth: Yes, occasionally people are ill for extended periods of time, and they cannot work. But it is the fact that they cannot work, not the cost of health care, that puts them in a precarious financial situation. Healthcare costs plummeted once government got out of the business and inventors entered. New healthcare inventions monitor your body continuously, tracking sugars, electrolytes, endocrine levels, etc. and immediately take steps to correct any imbalances or alert the person that they need additional help. Other bloodstream devices target cancer cells, and others can do minor repairs to damaged muscles and tissue, Not to mention all the new genetic therapies.

Interviewer: Wow. Are people happier?

Farnsworth: (Smiles) Wealth doesn’t buy happiness?

Interviewer: Exactly.

Farnsworth: I’ve got to go now. But I will just say that in my world the opportunities are almost limitless. These opportunities allow young people to become an expert in new fields in several years. We have what you would consider almost limitless opportunities both in our careers and as consumers. In my world things are constantly changing, we’re not burdened with endless arbitrary rules, laws are stable, understandable, and predictable, and we pay almost nothing in taxes. What do you think?

## Appendix: Inventions and Art

This appendix delves further into the question of what is an invention and what is art mainly by way of examples.

1) Is fire an invention?

Fire exists a priori to man or separate from man so it is not a human creation and, therefore, not an invention. However, the ability to light a fire by rubbing two sticks together is a human creation, and it has an objective result, so it is an invention. Techniques for creating fire, controlling fire, and transporting fire are human creations with objective results, so they are inventions.

2) Is mathematics an invention?

Mathematics (excluding applied math) is a logical system that exists separate from man, much like gravity exists whether we know about it or not. Mathematics is the process of uncovering a logical system, for instance, Euclidean geometry or algebra. As a result, mathematics is not a human creation. This is true despite the fact that there are objective answers to mathematical problems. However, when a mathematician describes what they have uncovered this is art because it is a human creation but it does not have an objective result. The description of the math will do nothing by itself and has a different reaction by different observers, often, confusion in most observers but not in those skilled in that area of math.

Applied mathematics is not a logical system that exists separate from man. It is a human creation. For instance, there are several methods for calculating the sine of an angle. Therefore, they are human creations, but they do nothing by themselves. In other words, they have a subject result and are, therefore, art.

3) Is a computer program an invention?

A computer program is a sequence of written commands. This sequence of written commands is clearly a human creation. However, the program does nothing by itself, so it has a subjective result and is, therefore, art and subject to copyright laws. In the language of patent law, computer programs per se are not patentable (inventions).

When a computer program is executed by a computer, however, it does have an objective result. For instance, it might determine the sine of an angle or sort names into an alphabetical order. Thus, software executed by a computer is an invention.

  
  

## Appendix: Fixing the Patent System

  
  

As stated earlier, there is not enough space in this book to explain a proper patent system that protects the property rights of inventors. However, I will highlight some of the bigger issues and their solutions. The most important change is to correctly define what an invention is. In United States law, this would require a change to 35 U.S.C. § 101 to state that an invention is a human creation with an objective result. This should be determined based on the description of the invention and not the claims of a patent. I will divide the rest of this appendix into the groups of litigation, obtaining a patent, and business issues.

Litigation

While the talk of a patent litigation explosion has been shown to be false multiple times, it is a legitimate complaint that patent lawsuits are too expensive and take too long. However, this is not a problem confined to patent lawsuits. The federal rules of procedure allow litigators to go on multi-year discovery explorations in the name of getting to the truth. The reality is that litigators use this to spend the other side into submission or just to pad their fees. As a result, some litigators threaten litigation and then force innocent parties to settle because of the potential costs of litigation. However, this is not confined to patents. It is used in medical malpractice lawsuits, securities litigation, product liability litigation, and by government agencies such as the EPA, SEC, OSHA, etc. The rules on discovery for federal lawsuits should be tightened and severely time limited. This would go a long way to reducing the cost and time of all federal lawsuits.

The presumption of validity in patent cases has become a joke, which means that every patent lawsuit reexamines this issue. In order to show a patent is invalid at trial, the defendant should have to show that the claims are not novel and the court should do everything possible to try to preserve an interpretation of the claims that make them valid. However, vague claim drafting or vague wording in the specification should be construed against the patentee, just as it is in the case of contracts.

The duty to disclose prior art to the patent office should be withdrawn. Failure to comply with this duty, which is called fraud on the patent office, can result in your patent being invalid, which is why litigators spend years and millions of dollars in discovery looking for a smoking gun. This rule also tends to be redundant. If the prior art found by the defendant invalidates the patent, then the inventor’s motives are irrelevant and if the prior art does not invalidate the patent, then we should not allow defendants to use this as an excuse to invalidate the property rights of the inventor. This change would significantly reduce the amount of discovery and, therefore, the cost and time of litigation.

All antitrust analysis of patents should be considered invalid. Patents are property rights, and the present antitrust laws should be repealed for the reasons explained earlier. Only government-granted monopolies (duopolies, etc.) should be outlawed, as was the case with the Statute of Monopolies. Any court decision that uses any antitrust type analysis should be immediately considered an invalid decision and litigators who try to introduce this line of reasoning should be sanctioned.

We need special patent courts or, at least, all patent lawsuits should be done by attorneys who have a technical background and have prosecuted patent applications. In order to correctly decide any legal case, it is necessary to both understand the facts and the law, something that rarely happens in patent cases. Not one of the present Supreme Court justices has a technical background. They commonly do not understand the technology in the patent cases they review. In addition, they have no understanding of patent law. The reality is that none of the Supreme Court justices is legally or factually competent to try patent cases, and they have made a mess of patent law. The whole point of the 1952 Patent Act was to correct these sorts of errors on the part of the Supreme Court.

  
  

Obtaining a Patent

All new inventions are eligible for patent protection. The definition of an invention does not include “non-obviousness” as required in the United States or an “inventive step” as used in most of the rest of the world. The non-obviousness requirement is a logical contradiction if the word obviousness is taken literally. It is impossible for something that is novel, which means it did not exist before, to be obvious at the point in time when it was created. The non-obviousness requirement has resulted in all sorts of nonsense in patent law and was the result of unconstitutional activism on the part of the Supreme Court. For more information, see [Non-Obviousness: A Case Study in Judicial Activism](http://hallingblog.com/non-obviousness-a-case-study-in-judicial-activism/).

Some people have argued that mere novelty will result in trivial variations being patentable. Note that novelty here is related to inventions, so the claims must define a new invention, which means it is functionally different. Design patents and trade dress issues require that we differentiate between functional and esthetic features, so intellectual property professionals are already well schooled in defining these differences. Australia has novelty patents, and they appear to be working.

The publication of patent applications eighteen months after their earliest priority date should be repealed. A patent is a negotiation between the inventor and the government for their property rights. An inventor who does not like the deal he is obtaining should always be able to withdraw his application and keep his invention a trade secret.

The inventor is the first person to create an invention. The United States changed to a first to file with the passage of the America Invents Act (AIA). The whole of the AIA should be repealed. Note, there are some limited circumstance when a non-inventor can be the patent holder, and they relate to the situation where the inventor suppresses his invention, but that is a narrow legal exception.

Patents should be worldwide. One of the major problems with our patent system is that your rights stop at the border. This is different from any other property right. For instance, if I drive my car across the border into Canada, I still own my car. If I take my book across the border into Canada, I still own both the physical version of my book and the copyrights to my book. But, if I drive my invention across the border, I no longer own my invention. This situation existed for copyrights 150 years ago, and it was recognized that there was no logical reason for copyrights to end at a country’s border, and it discouraged the publication of domestic authors. The same is true of patents.

I suggest a system of reciprocity in which an inventor who obtains a patent in Canada, for example, has patent rights in the U.S. and vice versa. This would decrease the duplication of efforts across patent offices around the world and significantly reduce the present backlog in the U.S. Patent Office. More importantly, it would increase the value of a patent and increase the chance of obtaining funding for technology startups.

The US Patent Office (PTO) should be able to keep all the fees that it collects. The PTO should have a strict timeframe for examining a patent application, say six months. Failure to do so would result in the patent issuing.

All procedures to challenge patents that have multiplied in the United States, such as _inter partes_ reexamination, should be repealed. Third parties should have the ability to submit prior art that they believe is relevant to the validity of a patent.

The requirement to file prior art with the PTO should be withdrawn. In today’s world, the patent office’s ability to search the prior art is extremely powerful.

Maintenance fees or annuities should be eliminated. Maintenance fees are required to keep your patent in force and are a backhanded way to introduce a working requirement. In some countries, these fees make the patent system unavailable to all but the most wealthy people and corporations.

These reforms would reduce the cost and time of obtaining a patent. They would increase the value of obtaining a patent and open the patent system to more people. Finally, they would reduce the crony aspects of our current patent system.

  
  

Business Issues

The cost of clearing and trading rights in patents is too expensive today. In the middle 1800s, there were a large number of lawsuits over patents related to the sewing machine. The manufacturers and inventors got together and created a company to hold their patents, and everyone paid a royalty for access to these patents. The proceeds were paid out to the inventors based on the number and importance of their inventions. This was called a patent pool. The advent of the ideas embodied in the Sherman Antitrust Act resulted in government prosecutors breaking up patent pools.

In the copyright area, we have organizations such as BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC to quickly and inexpensively clear rights to songs. No such organizations exist for patents mainly because of the antitrust laws, which should be immediately repealed. The closest version of BMI for patents is industry standards organizations, but these organizations are focused on manufacturers, not inventors.

Because of the high cost and uncertainty of licensing patents, we have created a not-invented-here syndrome. Companies are both unwilling to license their patents and take licenses to other people’s patents. This results in underinvestment and dissemination of inventions or, worse, an attitude that stealing other people’s inventions is okay. Many of the present so-called patent reforms in the United States are designed to make it easier for big companies to steal other people’s inventions, while being able to enforce their patents because they have a larger war chest.

Patent clearance and licensing companies are absolutely a vital part of creating an efficient market for inventions, which will make us all wealthier and healthier.

Many people contributed to this book, and I want to thank them. However, any errors are mine alone. Peter Meza, a brilliant patent attorney, has probably read more versions and had more discussion with me about this book than any other person aside from my wife. Vinay Kohhatkar, the publisher of the online magazine [Savvy Street](http://www.thesavvystreet.com/), encouraged me to finish this project and provided invaluable insight as a beta test reader. James Brenner, a professor of chemical engineering and entrepreneur, provided excellent insight into the more technical aspects of the book, particularly the parts about entropy. Keith Werner, head of the [Gold Standard Institute](http://goldstandardinstitute.us/) and PhD economist, provided superb insight into the more standard economic concepts. Ian Shepard, inventor and entrepreneur, also encouraged me to write this book and provided excellent feedback. I had a stunningly talented group of beta test readers who were invaluable. There are certainly numerous other people that I should thank who provided help and insight as I was working out the ideas in this book; however, I decided to focus on my beta test readers. It is not easy work being a beta test reader.

  
  

  
  

  
  

# Part 3

  
  

## Philosophy of Science

  
  

This paper explores the philosophy of science. The philosophy of science is mainly concerned with metaphysics and epistemology, but it is not completely divorced from ethics. This paper defines the necessary philosophical underpinning of science. Note that I am not suggesting that every scientist holds or held this philosophy.

Identity: The fundamental principle of science is that A is A (Identity), meaning that things exist; they have certain properties; they always act in accordance with these properties; A does not suddenly become B without a reason. Aristotle had three laws of thought: **[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_classical_laws_of_thought#The_law_of_non-contradiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_classical_laws_of_thought#The_law_of_non-contradiction)**: 1) the Law of Identity, 2) the Law of non-contradiction, and 3) the Law of excluded middle. It seems to me that the second and third laws follow from the Law of Identity.

Causality is the second tenant of science, meaning things happen for a reason or for every effect there is a cause. This means that A is always A unless acted upon by another object/force. For example, gold is always gold unless it is acted on by another object/force. It means a body at rest stays at rest unless acted upon. Causality and Identity result in repeatability. In other words things in the same situation will act in the same way. A mass acted upon by a certain force will accelerate in a consistent way. Identity and causality provide the justification for experimentation. If an experiment is correctly setup to exclude other factors (object/forces) then it will have in the same result, excluding measurement and experimental errors. If any of these tenants were not true, then there would be no point to experimentation. If a lead ball’s mass could suddenly change without any cause, then experimentation would never lead to repeatable results. When we find out experiments are not repeatable, then we know that we have failed to account for a variable. Note the Identity and Causality tenets are the rejection of superstition.

Experimentation: The goal of experimentation is to isolate causes and effects. For instance, if we are to determine if the gravitational effect of an object on Earth is the same, independent of mass, we have to ensure that our experiment does not include other factors. For example, we cannot allow wind resistance in our experiment. This means the objects have to have an equal wind resistance, or better yet, we need to eliminate wind resistance in our experiment.

Since no experiment or measurement can be perfect, we take into account measurement/experimental errors. Note that if these errors are truly random (Gaussian), then they will average out for a continuous random variable and significantly reduce for a discrete random variable. If they are not random, then we have not properly setup of the experiment, meaning we have failed to account for a variable. Note the experimental tenet of science requires that we can trust our senses. This does not mean that our senses give us perfect information, but that the information we receive from our senses is also ruled by the Identity and Causality laws.

Theories: Identity and causality allow us to use logic and reason to categorize and predict results, or form hypothesis and theories. Experiments are used to verify or disprove these hypothesis. Smaller theories can be built upon using logic to create broader theories. For instance, inertia and Galileo’s law of falling can be applied to planets and tides, which is what Newton did in creating his ideas of motion and gravity.

A good scientific theory is one that explains and predicts many individual facts. Every theory so far is incomplete and it is where experiment does not agree with theory that leads to the next big leaps in science. Thus if we assume that heavier objects are subject to a greater gravitational acceleration than lighter objects, but we find that lead balls of differing masses fall at the same rate, we know we need to revisit this hypothesis/theory. This also means that there is an evolutionary or expanding nature to scientific theories. Newton’s laws of motion and gravity refined and expanded upon Galileo’s theory of inertia and his law of fall. Einstein’s relativity did not disprove Newton, it just refined and expanded on Newton’s at speeds near the speed of light and in regions of very large gravity. Part of how we know that Einstein’s theory of relativity is ‘correct’ is that it is consistent with Newton in certain regions and with the body of facts that Newton physics explained. There is a similar thing in mathematics, where we define over what range a statement is true. For instance, if a*b=c, then b=c/a, where a is a non-zero real number.

This evolutionary, expanding nature of scientific theories is the difference between a real science and pseudo science (or at least a poorly formed science). In a pseudo science a new theory can come along and predict totally different results. For instance, under classical economics printing money (counterfeiting) has a negative effect on the economy. Along comes Keynes and suddenly if the government prints money it causes an increase in wealth (GPD).

Perfect Knowledge: Does knowledge have to be perfect knowledge in order to be knowledge? Often scientific theories are attacked as being incomplete. Every scientific theory so far is incomplete, because we don’t know everything about everything. I am going to postulate that we cannot ever know everything because there is always a deeper layer of knowledge. For instance, Newton explains the effects of gravity but not how it works. In fact, Newton was greatly disturbed that his best explanation of gravity required action at a distance without some intermediate (corpuscle). Knowledge is certainty that a fact or theory is correct within certain limits and therefore repeatable in science. For instance, if a builder assumes that Earth is flat or described by Euclidean geometry will this inaccuracy cause any problems? Even if the builder is constructing a building with a mile long foundation, the error of assuming the Earth is flat is less than two inches or much less than the underlying variation in the terrain. On the other hand if I am sailing across the world or launching a spaceship and I assume that the Earth is flat, then I have a problem. This is like bounds in mathematics and as long as we know the bound of our knowledge it does not cause any problems. On the other hand, discovering the bounds of our knowledge is where the really interesting science and engineering occur and how we expand the bounds of our knowledge. The idea that knowledge has to be perfect seems to come from Plato’s idea of pure forms. Physics makes it clear that Plato’s ideal forms do not exist and are not necessary for science or realism. Attacking a scientific theory for failure to explain everything is meaningless, it is just saying we have not learned everything. It is only a valid attack on a scientific theory if it predicts something that turns out to not be so – a contradiction. Even then the contradiction may only occur within certain bounds or only matter within in certain bounds, in fact any well tested scientific theory will only be meaningfully incorrect within certain bounds.

In keeping with this idea of imperfect or lack of absolute knowledge, I am sure my thesis (philosophy of science) is not ‘perfect.’ As a result, I have tried to define the minimum requirements for the philosophy of science. I have not for instance included Locke and Newton’s corpuscular ideas, which are really about their philosophy of how physics works.

Statistics as applied to physical sciences is not in conflict with the Law of Identity or Causality. Statistics are a way of bounding our lack of knowledge about certain factors. For instance, if you know all the initial conditions of a coin flip, you can determine whether it will land on heads or tails exactly. In grad school in physics I had to solve a similar problem of a quarter slightly tilted to one side and given an initial velocity, will it land on heads or tails. There is an exact solution, it is not random. Statistics also deal with measurement errors and uncertainty in the conditions of the experiment. None of this in anyway suggests that the Law of Identity or Causality is suspended.

Curve fitting: There has been a popular theory in physics that all we are doing is curve fitting and understanding is illusory and wrong. Curve fitting is something engineers do when working from first principles is too complex. For instance, we know that the resistance of a thermistor varies with temperature, but we cannot solve the relationship from first principles. In this case we will take a number of measurements (experiments) and then just fit a curve so that we can covert an output resistance, actually voltage to a temperature. Curve fitting is useful, but it does not provide an understanding of the underlying phenomena and is generally limited to very specific situations. It is not the goal of what science does. Science looks to understand the underlying physical phenomena, not just model it. Curve fitting can tell you the rate that an object will fall to Earth, but not why and it can’t tell you why this is related to planetary orbits.

Animate objects present additional challenges. For instance, a tad pole turns into a frog. Does this violate the law of Identity? The answer is no because a tadpole never turns into a cat or something else. But with animate objects it is necessary to apply the law of identity at a finer granularity. For instance, are you the same person you were ten years ago? Well all the cells in your body have completely changed and you are older, so probably you have some wrinkles and of course ten years of experience you did not have. The difficulty with animate objects is that they can use internal energy to change their position or state. But when we look inside of the animate object we see that it acts according to the law of Identity and Causality.

Ethics: The philosophy of science does include an ethics, which is that we must report (record) data accurately. Fudging the data in science is the greatest sin in science. This is one of the reasons the proponents of Anthropomorphic Global Warming (AGW) cannot be taken serious. Not only have they repeatedly lied and fudged the data but their advocates suggest this is okay – even required morally. It also why much of economic data can no longer be taken seriously.

The Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) of Quantum Mechanics (QM)

There was a great fight at the beginning of QM over how to interpret Schrodinger’s wave equation. Einstein, Schrodinger and others never accepted the point particle statistical model (PPSM) of QM. Nothing in the mathematics or experimental evidence required the PPSM of QM and certainly nothing required the CI model. The main justification for the statistical approach to QM is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. If we can only know the location and momentum of a particle with certain precision then we cannot know the original state of a system exactly or the final state of the system exactly. This is how I resolved the statistical nature of QM while I was in grad school in physics and I would bet that this is how most physicists think about this issue. Note new research has shown problems with the uncertainty principle. However, the CI does not resolve the issue this way. The CI has never actually been well defined, but here is a rough sketch of their ideas:

a) negation of causality

b) negation of realism and

c) involvement of infinite and imaginary velocities or masses.

Note that part (a) directly contradicts one of the fundamental tenants of science. You may think I am exaggerating, so here are some quotes:

Heisenberg[117](#sdfootnote117sym) states clearly:

"The law of causality is no longer applied in quantum theory."

In order to be coherent, physicists today should no longer try to find the cause of a physical phenomenon.” According to Heisenberg's statement, there is no cause, it is simple magic. Greenberger[118](#sdfootnote118sym) uses the same expression and states simply, "Quantum Mechanics is Magic".

Much more recently, following the use of the Copenhagen interpretation, Feynman[119](#sdfootnote119sym) concludes:

"The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with experiments. So I hope you can accept Nature as she is - absurd."

Even worse, Mermin states that the results of those absurd interpretations are enjoyable. He[120](#sdfootnote120sym) writes:

"The EPR experiment is as close to magic as any physical phenomenon I know of, and magic should be enjoyed." (Whole section[121](#sdfootnote121sym))

You may think the rejection of realism is also not true. But here is another quote by Heisenberg.

"The next step was taken by Berkeley. If actually all our knowledge is derived from perception, there is no meaning in the statement that the things really exist; because if the perception is given it cannot possibly make any difference whether the things exist or do not exist. Therefore, to be perceived is identical with existence."[122](#sdfootnote122sym)

Clearly, the CI rejects the fundamental tenants of the science of philosophy. We know that without causality the whole point of experimentation is meaningless – if anything can happen what is the point of an experiment. The only logical result is that even the proponents of CI did not believe what they were saying. However, the problems with the PPSI of QM keep compounding. Below is a list of some of those problems.

1) Requires infinite velocities

2) Spin makes no sense for a point particles.[123](#sdfootnote123sym)

3) Point Particles: “Because point particles are assumed to occupy no space, they have to be accompanied by infinite charge density, infinite mass density, infinite energy density. Then these infinities get removed once more by something called "renormalization." It's all completely crazy. But our physics community has been hammering away at it for decades. Einstein called it Ptolemaic epicycles all over again.”[124](#sdfootnote124sym)

4) The Laser: “At the heart of laser action is perfect alignment of the crests and troughs of myriad waves of light. Their location and momentum must be theoretically knowable. But this violates the holiest canon of Copenhagen theory: Heisenberg Uncertainty. Bohr and Von Neumann proved to be true believers in Heisenberg's rule. Both denied that the laser was possible.”[125](#sdfootnote125sym)

  
  

Carver Mead, who studied under Feynman and worked closely with him had this to say about the CI. "It is my firm belief that the last seven decades of the twentieth will be characterized in history as the dark ages of theoretical physics."[126](#sdfootnote126sym)

  
  

  
  

## Aristotle and Rand vs Hume: Causation and Induction

(Who Killed the Enlightenment Kant or Hume?)

  
  

Ayn Rand and many scholars blame Kant for killing the Enlightenment. Kant is the founder of what I call the Germany anti-Enlightenment movement. It seems to me that David Hume may be as responsible for killing the Enlightenment or more so than Kant partly because his arguments are more understandable. Hume is part of what I call the Scottish anti-Enlightenment. Francis Hutcheson is usually considered the father of the Scottish anti-Enlightenment, but Hume is its most powerful advocate.

Hume provides three arguments that attack the core of the Enlightenment:

1) His skepticism of causation

2) His skepticism of induction

3) His “is-ought” attack on ethics.

Rand concentrated her attention on the third problem. She explained, “The fact that a living entity is, determines what it ought to do.”

The first two arguments are actually interrelated for Hume. He was grappling with the problem that for deductive syllogisms to be true the premise statements must be true, but how do we arrive at the premise concepts? The classical example is:

  
  

All men are mortal.

Socrates is a man.

Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

  
  

For Hume this syllogism raises the issue of how do we know that all men are mortal? We have not met all men, and all men who have lived have not died, and how do we know that the future will be like the past? Hume realized that all abstract statements, indeed all concepts must be start with individual perceptions or instances, unless god or someone gives us a tablet with all the abstractions. But how do we go from particular instances to an abstraction? For example, all the people I know are mortal, to “all men are mortal”? This is a question of induction and Hume realized for induction to be true, we must assume that cause and effect exists and is knowable. However Hume did not see any justification for our confidence that cause and effect exists or is knowable. Hume saw cause and effect as a psychological pattern recognition that at best has a probabilistic certainty. Thus to Hume his skepticism about induction and causal relationships are intimately interconnected.

Hume ignores the law of identity in his arguments, which is at least in part how I think Rand and Aristotle would respond to Hume. A thing is what it is and therefore it has certain properties. If a thing changes then we know that something caused it to change. Otherwise it would violate the law of identity. Perhaps Hume’s response would be to attack the law of identity, however this would be an extraordinary claim and therefore require extraordinary evidence.[127](#sdfootnote127sym)

Hume illustrates his ideas on the lack of causality with billiard balls. This is how Wikipedia explains it:

For example, when one thinks of "a billiard ball moving in a straight line toward another", one can conceive that the first ball bounces back with the second ball remaining at rest, the first ball stops and the second ball moves, or the first ball jumps over the second, etc. There is no reason to conclude any of these possibilities over the others.

This example shows that Hume is ignoring the law of identity.[128](#sdfootnote128sym) For instance, the first ball cannot jump over the second ball without violating the law of identity.[129](#sdfootnote129sym) Billiard balls do not jump for no reason. The same is true of the first ball bouncing back and the second ball staying in place. A billiard ball when struck with sufficient moves.

A famous example to illustrate Hume’s attack on induction is the black swan scenario. In this scenario you observe one hundred swans and they are all white. Thus you infer (induction) that all swans are white. The next day you see a black swan. This is essentially what Hume thinks scientists are doing. Hume is making this argument about 50 years after Isaac Newton’s Principia. I think this shows that Hume had an agenda to attack the Enlightenment. Newton’s laws of mechanics and gravity had overwhelming shown the power of science and reason and therefore induction, but Hume chose to reject them. Hume did not even come close to meeting his burden of proof in this argument.

The swan example shows another flaw in Hume’s argument. Hume has made an inference based on an accidental cause. I consider this an intellectual dishonest argument. Eggs are white, clouds are white, paper is white, some flowers are white, and so are some other birds. Drawing the conclusion that all swans are white is to focus on an accidental, as I think Aristotle would have point out. Most humans are within a certain height range, but that would be no reason to define humans as beings above 4.5 feet or below 6.5 feet. Hume in this example ignores what is an important or causal feature of swans for a trivial feature. This is worthy of a side show magician not serious philosophy or science. His excuse would be that there is no causation.

  
  

Perfect knowledge.

This is another error that people who argue along the lines of Hume make. An example of this argument was used to attack Newton’s ideas on gravity. People argued that Newton had failed to explain why masses have gravity or how gravity works at a distance and therefore they rejected all of Newton’s ideas on gravity. The criticism is fair, but the conclusion is not. In fact, Newton acknowledged this was a problem, but that did not mean that he had not contributed enormously to the understanding of gravity.

The perfect knowledge argument is that if you do not know everything with perfect precision, then you do not know anything. The only way to you can meet this definition of knowledge is to be omniscient, which is metaphysically impossible. Thus they setup a false argument by setting a standard for knowledge that can never be met.

Rand’s response would be that perfect knowledge proponents are using the wrong definition of knowledge.

“Knowledge” is . . . a mental grasp of a fact(s) of reality, reached either by perceptual observation or by a process of reason based on perceptual observation.[130](#sdfootnote130sym)

A related attack on knowledge is to ignore its context and then show it does not work outside of that context.

Knowledge is contextual . . . By “context” we mean the sum of cognitive elements conditioning the acquisition, validity or application of any item of human knowledge.[131](#sdfootnote131sym)

In the case of Newton his mechanics are correct within the context in which the knowledge was developed. There are areas (context) where Newtonian mechanics is not correct. All this proves is that Newton was not omniscient, not that “he got it all wrong.”

  
  

Probabilistic knowledge

One of the proposed solutions to Hume and suggested by Hume himself is that knowledge is probabilistic.[132](#sdfootnote132sym) Karl Popper is probably the best known advocate of this idea. This idea as applied to the black swan case above would be that the more swans we see the more certain we are that all swans are white, however we can never know for sure. Thus we never know anything and scientific theories are never true, they have just not been proven incorrect yet.

This idea has become quite popular in the scientific community. However, probabilistic knowledge ignores the law of identity. Probability is built on the law of identity.[133](#sdfootnote133sym) Probability theory was developed to understand the odds in games of chance. For instance, what is the probability that a die when rolled will land on a six. If we rolled a die and the position of the numbers could change without cause {that is the die could violate the law of identity) then probability theory would not work. In order to determine the probability of the die being six when rolled, we determine all the possible outcomes (law of identity) and then we determined how many of these are a six. Probability also does not defy causation, it assumes that we do not know the initial conditions and the initial conditions are random. If we know the initial conditions then we can use Newtonian mechanics to determine exactly which number will appear on the die when we roll it.

Now some people will counter that is not true since we don’t know if a fly will land on the die or an asteroid will land on us just as the die is thrown. This is context dropping of knowledge and this was discussed above.

The probabilistic hypothesis of knowledge shows a lack of understanding of the law of identity.

  
  

Conclusion: Why Does This Matter?

David Hume is still highly influential today. For instance, his “is-ought” argument underpins the moral and cultural relativism arguments of today. His attack on causality shows up in Karl Popper’s ideas that knowledge is probabilistic and we can never know anything. This leads to today’s modern cynicism. It also is the basis of the environmentalists so called “precautionary principle.” Hume’s attack on causation allows Keynesians to maintain that consumption is more important than production, modern economics to maintain that production is more important than invention, or that capital causes inventions ,or Obama’s “you didn’t build that.”

Confusing cause and effect is the source of numerous errors that lead to real problems in the real world. For instance, are increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere the cause of increasing temperatures on Earth or is it the result of increasing temperatures.

What is amazing to me is that Hume wrote these ideas after Locke, Bacon, Newton, Galileo, Robert Boyle, etc. In my opinion, Hume and his non-continental followers have not been given the scrutiny they deserve.

Hume deserves equal billing with Kant for the ignominy of killing the Enlightenment and the resulting human suffering.

  
  

  
  

## Is Objectivism Compatible with Austrian Economics?

  
  

There have been a number of papers comparing Objectivism to Austrian Economics. The motivation appears to be Rand’s relationship with Ludwig Von Mises, since both are known for advocating Laissez Faire Economics. Most of these papers have focused on ethics, particularly whether the subjective theory of value in Austrian Economics (AE) is consistent with Objectivists ethics. Most of these papers have argued that AE (at least the Menger-Mises side) and Rand are actually very similar and compatible, but not all including Rand herself. In order to arrive at these conclusions, the authors have often provided nuanced explanations of what the Austrians or Rand said. For instance, Richard Johnsson argues:

It seems to be a well-established fact that there are similarities between Rand and Menger, despite the objectivist/subjectivist issue. Once we concede that something can be intrinsic value, in Moore’s sense, I believe the differences between Austrian subjectivism and Rand’s Objectivism vanish.[134](#sdfootnote134sym)

Roderick Long concludes in his paper, _Praxeology: Who Needs It_:

I have argued that the features of Misesian praxeology that Rand found most objectionable—its aprioristic methodology, its value subjectivism, and its claims about motivational psychology—can be reinterpreted in ways that make them congenial to Rand’s philosophical principles while still preserving the essential points that Mises was seeking to make. Hence there is no reason for those of a Randian philosophical bent to deprive themselves of the powerful methodological instrument developed by Mises and his fellow Austrians: praxeology, the a priori science of human action.[135](#sdfootnote135sym)

And Ed Younkins argues:

Objectivism’s Aristotelian perspective on the nature of man and the world and on the need to exercise one’s virtues can be viewed as complementary with the praxeology of Austrian economics.[136](#sdfootnote136sym)

Objectivists are generally more critical of the Hayek branch of AE. For instance, David Kelley writes “if a defense of freedom depends on individualism, and individualism presupposes individuals capable of genuine self-direction, Hayek cannot successfully defend freedom.”[137](#sdfootnote137sym) Ed Younkins says this about Hayek, “Hayek is primarily concerned with the nature, scope, limits, use, and abuse of reason in human life. For Hayek, a man’s knowledge of the world and himself is at best limited, incomplete, and uncertain.”[138](#sdfootnote138sym)

This paper will focus primarily on the similarities and differences of the epistemology of various Austrian Economists (Menger, Mises, Hayek) and Rand. Rand and the economists will be taken at their word. Unlike many previous researchers, this paper will argue that the epistemological theories of Austrian Economists are incompatible with Objectivism and inconsistent with the science project of the Enlightenment.

  
  

**Menger**

Menger lays out his epistemology in his book _Investigations into the Method of Social Sciences_.[139](#sdfootnote139sym) Lawrence H. White in the introduction to the book, explains.

Fortunately, Menger draws and even emphasizes a suitable distinction between the "realist-empirical orientation of theoretical research" and the "exact" orientation (p. 59). The search for so-called ,”exact laws” alone is more appropriately considered the task of purely theoretical research in economics. We can make sense of "exact laws" as theoretical propositions which (necessarily) take an "if-then" form: if conditions A and B hold, then condition C must also obtain. Menger rightly insists (pp. 70, 215) that realist-empirical generalizations (e.g., A and B are usually accompanied by C) can by their nature never attain the strictness that necessarily characterizes logical implications. The two sorts of "laws" are on different epistemological planes. So without too much dissent from Menger's thought we may divide economic theory from economic history where he divided strict theory from what he considered an empirical sort of theory. What is empirical is really historical, and this accounts for its different status from what is deductive.[140](#sdfootnote140sym)

Lawrence H. White goes on to explain:

But this is not because, like some economists, he (Menger) sees empiricism or positivism or falsificationism as the only proper method for both social science and natural science. Instead he argues (p. 59 n. 18) that both the search for empirical regularities and the formulation of non-empirical, non-falsifiable ("exact") theories are methods common to both economics and such natural science fields as chemistry. In viewing theoretical research in every field as having a non-empirical proposition at its core, Menger's position bears some resemblance to that of modern philosophers of science. [141](#sdfootnote141sym)

As a person who has a masters’ degree in physics and a BS in Electrical Engineering and has worked with scientists and engineers his whole life, I am unaware of any so-called theoretical side of chemistry or other natural science that is ‘non-empirical, non-falsifiable ("exact")’ nor have I ever heard such an idea proposed by others.

Ed Younkins describes Menger’s epistemology as:

Menger distinguishes between the empirical-realistic orientation to theory and the exact orientation to theory (36–44). Whereas the empirical-realistic branch of economics studies the regularities in the succession and coexistence of real phenomena, the exact orientation studies the laws governing ideal economic phenomena. He explains that empirical-realistic theory is concerned with regularities in the coexistence and succession of phenomena discovered by observing actual types and typical relationships of phenomena. Empirical realistic theory is subject to exceptions and to change over time. Theoretical economics in its realistic orientation derives empirical laws that are valid only for the spatial and temporal relationships from which they were observed. Empirical laws can only be alleged to be true within a particular spatiotemporal domain. The realistic orientation can only lead to real types and to the particular. The study of individual or concrete phenomena in time and space is the realm of the historical sciences.[142](#sdfootnote142sym)

Younkins and White both seem to agree that according to Menger there is theoretical side of economics that is exact and cannot be tested empirically. Menger argues there is also an empirical side of economics, which is not exact and subject to change over time.

Menger’s epistemology should be familiar as it is a restatement of the analytic-synthetic distinction. “Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.”[143](#sdfootnote143sym) Not surprisingly the origin of this distinction can be found in Kant and comes from his metaphysics, in which he argues there is a noumenal and phenomenal realm.[144](#sdfootnote144sym) The noumenal realm is a realm of pure ideas and the phenomenal world is a realm where our senses are engaged. This logically gives rise to an epistemological analytic-synthetic distinction.

Leonard Peikoff states, “The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the following choice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; if it is about existents, it cannot be proved.” Menger seems to disagree with at least the analytic (theoretical) side. Menger seems to argue that theoretical laws of economics can be derived by just thinking about them. Somehow these theoretical laws can tell us something empirical about economics. Whether that is true or not, it is not consistent with Objectivist epistemology and it is not science. The philosophy of science is a complex topic especially now days when Karl Popper is supposed to be the foremost philosopher of science and the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics appears to undermine objectivity and even the law of identity. However, even these deviations in the philosophy of science do not suggest that science can be divorced from empirical evidence.

  
  

**Mises**

Mises’ epistemology is described in his praxeology, which is supposed to be the study of human action. The Action Axiom is the fundamental starting point of praxeology and it states “that individual human beings act, that is, on the primordial fact that individuals engage in conscious actions toward chosen goals.”[145](#sdfootnote145sym) According to Mises the principles (axioms) “are, like those of logic and mathematics, a priori. They are not subject to verification or falsification on the ground of experience and facts. They are both logically and temporally antecedent to any comprehension of historical facts.”[146](#sdfootnote146sym) Mises continues, “A fashionable tendency in contemporary philosophy is to deny the existence of any a priori knowledge. All human knowledge, it is contended, is derived from experience.”[147](#sdfootnote147sym)

According to Long, Rand objected to this idea of a priori knowledge in her marginalia of her copy of Human Action. “There is no ‘a priori’ knowledge,” Rand insisted in the margins; “[t]here is no knowledge not derived from experience” (Rand 1995a, 113–14).”[148](#sdfootnote148sym)

Long argues that Rand’s definition of axioms is the same as Mises’ a prior. Long admits that Rand ultimately bases her axioms on reality while Mises does not, but relies on Rand’s explanation of an axiom as “a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it.”[149](#sdfootnote149sym)

According to praxeology the attempt to deny the action axiom necessarily means that you are acting towards a purpose. While it might be true that the person arguing against the action axiom is taking action toward a goal, it is not true that a person having a seizure is taking ‘conscious actions toward chosen goals’. A person in an abusive relationship suffering from ‘battered person syndrome’ is not acting towards a conscious purpose, toward chosen goals. Advocates of praxeology might argue that the abused person feels responsible for the abuse they are suffering and therefore they are working toward the goal of relieving their guilt. Any impartial observer would say that the abused person’s actions are not working toward relieving their guilt or getting out the abusive relationship. In economics it is at least an open question whether the idea of unintended consequences fits the action axiom. In that case the result obtained was not those the person(s) was striving for.

Note, Rand says that an axiom requires a person accept it in any attempt to deny it. It is clear that in arguing a person having a seizure is not consistent with the action axiom, the arguer has not accepted the action axiom in their argument.

Another part of Mises’ action axiom is, human action is necessarily always rational. “The term ‘rational action’ is therefore pleonastic and must be rejected as such. When applied to the ultimate ends of action, the terms rational and irrational are inappropriate and meaningless.”[150](#sdfootnote150sym) “However one twists things, one will never succeed in formulating the notion of ‘irrational’ action whose ‘irrationality’ is not founded upon an arbitrary judgment of value.”[151](#sdfootnote151sym)

This is a clear contradiction between Rand and Mises on an epistemological and ethical level. This is not a minor disagreement, but goes to the very fundamentals of Mises’ praxeology and Objectivism. Long however argues that this is not the case. “Mises of course did not mean that people always pursue the most rationally defensible ends (for Mises there are no such things) or even that, given their ends, people always choose the most rationally defensible means to their ends. In part, what he meant was simply that human action is purposeful.” [152](#sdfootnote152sym) According to Long, when Mises says people always act rational, he means “in a manner appropriate to their situation in the way of actually seeing it that is constitutive of their action. And this is a claim that Rand has no reason to reject”[153](#sdfootnote153sym)

Rand defines reason as, “Reason integrates man’s perceptions by means of forming abstractions or conceptions, thus raising man’s knowledge from the perceptual level, which he shares with animals, to the conceptual level, which he alone can reach. The method which reason employs in this process is logic—and logic is the art of non-contradictory identification.”[154](#sdfootnote154sym) Thus for Rand to act rationally is to act in accordance with reason. All the massaging of what Rand and Mises meant cannot reconcile these two radically different positions. While English was Mises’ second language, these ideas about praxeology were fundamental and Mises never retracted his statements or reinterpreted them and neither did Rand. An informal review of video lectures by Austrian Economists shows that they take Mises at his word. It is very dangerous to reinterpret what people are saying.

Mises is clear that praxeology is a type of philosophical rationalism.

“[Praxeology’s] cognition is purely formal and general without reference to the material content and particular features of the actual case. Its statements and propositions are not derived from experience. They are, like those of logic and mathematics, a priori.” Mises, Human Action, p. 32

“All theorems of economics are necessarily valid in every instance in which all the assumptions presupposed are given.” Mises, Human Action, p. 66

“Apart from the fact that these conclusions cannot be “tested” by historical or statistical means, there is no need to test them since their truth has already been established. Historical fact enters into these conclusions only by determining which branch of the theory is applicable in any particular case.” Murray N. Rothbard [https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics](https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics).

Philosophical rationalism is defined as “the doctrine that reason alone is a source of knowledge and is independent of experience.”[155](#sdfootnote155sym) Philosophical rationalism is commonly associated with Descartes and Spinoza. Here is what Rand said about rationalism.

[Philosophers came to be divided] into two camps: those who claimed that man obtains his knowledge of the world by deducing it exclusively from concepts, which come from inside his head and are not derived from the perception of physical facts (the Rationalists)—and those who claimed that man obtains his knowledge from experience, which was held to mean: by direct perception of immediate facts, with no recourse to concepts (the Empiricists).[156](#sdfootnote156sym)

Mises epistemology is not science. At a minimum science always requires that concepts (hypothesis) are checked against reality and reality is ultimate determiner of what is true. William Thomas, Director of Programs at The Atlas Society, argues that Mises was not a philosophical rationalist and shows that some of the concepts Mises uses, such as money, can only be derived from experience. This is another attempt to massage the words of Mises. What this shows is that Mises’ praxeology and his ideas about money result in a logical contradiction. Rand’s response from Atlas Shrugged might be “Contradictions do not exist. Whenever you think that you are facing a contradiction, check your premises. You will find that one of them is wrong.”

An interesting point is that Mises’ subjective theory of value is fundamental to his ideas on praxeology. “Let us note that praxeology does not assume that a person’s choice of values or goals is wise or proper . . . “[157](#sdfootnote157sym) “However one twists things, one will never succeed in formulating the notion of ‘irrational’ action whose ‘irrationality’ is not founded upon an arbitrary judgment of value.”[158](#sdfootnote158sym) As a result, it is impossible to separate the subjective theory of value from Mises praxeology.

George Reisman makes some important points about Mises’ contention that economics (science) should be value-free.

The notion that science and value should be divorced is utterly contradictory. It itself expresses a value judgment in its very utterance. And it is not only self-contradictory, but contradictory of the most cherished principles of science as well. Science itself is built on a foundation of values that all scientists are logically obliged to defend: values such as reason, observation, truth, honesty, integrity, and the freedom of inquiry. In the absence of such values, there could be no science. The leading historical illustration of the truth of these propositions is the case of Galileo and the moral outrage which all lovers of science and truth must feel against those who sought to silence him. [159](#sdfootnote159sym)

  
  

**Hayek**

F.A. Hayek’s epistemological ideas are contained his ideas on “cultural evolution”. Hayek was proud of his ideas on cultural evolution and considered them central to his ideas on economics. “The theory, of which Hayek himself was proud, is on all accounts central to his economic, social, and political project”[160](#sdfootnote160sym)

Cultural evolution is the idea that social institutions, such as ethics, law, and economic systems are created by a non-rational evolutionary process. “According to this theory, rules, norms and practices evolve in a process of natural selection operating at the level of the group. Thus, groups that happen to have more efficient rules and practices tend to grow, multiply, and ultimately displace other groups.”[161](#sdfootnote161sym)

Bruce Caldwell describes cultural evolution as:

The term “cultural evolution” refers to the evolution of a tradition of learnt rules, norms, ethical precepts, and practices, “especially those dealing with several property, honesty, contract, exchange, trade, competition, gain, and privacy” (Hayek 1988:12). This cultural heritage emerged through “a process of winnowing and sifting, directed by the differential advantages gained by groups from practices adopted for some unknown and perhaps purely accidental reasons” (Hayek 1979:155). The traditions and institutions that resulted allowed the development of a vast extended order, one capable of sustaining huge increases in population, an order that would have been considered fantastical to earlier humans existing under more primitive conditions.[162](#sdfootnote162sym)

According to Hayek, no individual is capable of using reason to determine which social institution will end up with the best result beforehand or why a particular set of social norms does work well. Linda C. Raeder in _Humantis_ makes this point and also points out that David Hume’s ideas entered the mainstream libertarian movement through Hayek.

“The picture of man as a being who, thanks to his reason, can rise above the values of civilization, in order to judge it from the outside . . . is an illusion.” For Hayek, morals, values, and reason are entirely natural phenomena, evolutionary adaptations which have enabled man to survive and flourish in his particular kind of world.

Perhaps no other area of Burke’s and Hayek’s thought is as congruent as their understanding of the role of reason in human affairs; their views are so close as to suggest that Hayek’s thought on this issue is merely an elaboration, although quite an extensive one, of Burke’s theme. Hayek developed several of Burke’s most crucial insights: 1) the priority of social experience (or “tradition”) over reason; 2) the notion that inherited social institutions embody a “superindividual wisdom” which transcends that available to the conscious reasoning mind; and 3) the impotence of reason to ‘design’ a viable social order.[163](#sdfootnote163sym)

David Kelley elaborates on this point:

Hayek, by contrast, is a critic of what he calls ―constructive rationalism. His concept of rationalism is somewhat idiosyncratic, and is not equivalent to Rand‘s conception of reason. Nevertheless, it leads him to claim that ―no universally valid system of ethics can ever be known to us, which is obviously not consistent with her view. For Hayek, moral rules have a status lying ―between instinct and reason.

Is Hayek anti-reason? It’s hard to say, however arguing that reason is fundamentally limited (as opposed to making a mistake) in understanding reality without any real evidence is an attack on reason itself. Like Hume, Hayek cannot say reason is completely impotent, because what would the point of writing. Writing presumes some ability to reason.

Hayek’s case for freedom is based on the limits of reason. In order for Hayek’s cultural evolution to work, you cannot substitute the decisions of a single leader (or small group) for those of the masses. To do so undermines the evolutionary process. As David Kelley explains:

This case for market freedom is essentially negative. Hayek seems to think that if socialist planning were possible, socialism might be the morally ideal system. But the inescapable ignorance of would-be planners excludes that possibility: ―If there were omniscient men, if we could know not only all that affects the attainment of our present wishes but also our future wants and desires, there would be little case for liberty.

Hayek does not think that reason can tell you how or why social institutes, including the law and ethics work. This is totally inconsistent with Rand’s ideas and undermines the very idea of science.

Interestingly, Hayek’s position on ‘the subjective theory or value’ is a fundamental part of his epistemology, just like Mises’. His cultural evolution requires that we cannot formulate a rational ethics because that would undermine the evolutionary process. As a result, every ethical system is subjective and therefore so is every law. The most we can do is put our faith in the process and blindly hope our ethical and legal systems are better than they were in the past because of the evolutionary process of cultural evolution.

  
  

**Economics vs. Philosophy**

It is clear that Austrian Economics’ epistemological positions are incompatible with Objectivism and science more generally. However it is entirely possible that despite this, Austrian Economics has achieved great things in economics. For instance, David Kelley has shown that John Locke made a number of epistemological errors with respect to perception, in his book _The Evidence of the Senses,_ and yet Locke’s ideas on Natural Rights are still profound and fundamentally sound.

In this case however, when Objectivists and Austrians are talking they are not even speaking the same language. For instance, when Rand says she is for capitalism, she means “a social system based on the recognition of individual rights, including property rights”[164](#sdfootnote164sym) By individual rights, Rand means a moral claim based on man’s nature and discovered using reason. Austrians do not think that a rational ethics is possible. As a result to Austrians, capitalism is an economics system that has low levels of governmental interference, based on some utilitarian criteria. (You cannot live without an ethical system, so most Austrians default to utilitarianism)

When Objectivists talk about property rights, they mean an ethical claim to take action with respect to something, such as land. This ethical claim is based on a rational, natural rights system. When Austrians talk about “property rights”, they do not really mean a “right” in any way except a purely arbitrary legal claim. Austrians argument for “property rights” is a purely utilitarian or historical argument (Hayek) that can be fudged to meet the utilitarian goal or historical precedence.

These differences result in real differences in economic policy. Menger, for instance, advocated 1) public works constructed by the state such as roads, railways and canals, 2) government established agricultural and vocational training institutions, 3) state intervention to stop clearing of forests on private property in the mountains of Austria when this clearing had serious and bad effects on agriculture, and 4) government intervention to stop child labour.[165](#sdfootnote165sym)

Hayek was in favor social security, some sort of government provided health care, emergency government assistance for natural disasters, and suggested that manipulating the money supply might be used to alleviate recessions/depressions.[166](#sdfootnote166sym)

Even Ludwig Von Mises waffles on economic policies that are inconsistent with capitalism as an Objectivist would define it.

There are certainly cases in which people may consider definite restrictive measures as justified. Regulations concerning fire prevention are restrictive and raise the cost of production. But the curtailment of total output they bring about is the price to be paid for avoidance of greater disaster. The decision about each restrictive measure is to be made on the ground of a meticulous weighing of the costs to be incurred and the prize to be obtained. No reasonable man could possibly question this rule.[167](#sdfootnote167sym)

Note that Mises justification for fire regulations is based on utilitarianism, which Rand condemns as “’The greatest good for the greatest number’a is one of the most vicious slogans ever foisted on humanity.”[168](#sdfootnote168sym)

The Austrians sound a lot more like modern conservatives than capitalists. When it is a government policy that Austrians are in favor of, they are quite happy to override peoples’ individual rights. They just want these programs to be run more efficiently. Austrians make a number of errors in their analysis of the economy also, however there is not time in this paper to take on these issues.

  
  

**Conclusion**

Austrians often argue that if you do not support the Austrian school of economics then tell them which school (economists) do your support then, as if this was an election or a smorgasbord with a limited number of choice. Science is a creative endeavor and we are not limited only the exiting choices.

New Growth Economics’ central point is that wealth is created by the human mind. This should be exciting to Objectivists, because that sounds very much like Ayn Rand. It also points to an objective basis for economics. Every human needs to acquire and consume a minimum number of calories or they die.[169](#sdfootnote169sym) This provides an objective standard that is very similar to Rand’s standard for her ethics. It also ties economics to biology, particularly human biology, just like Rand tied her ethics to biology.

Inventions are the result of applying man’s reasoning power to the objective problems of life. The way we become wealthier is by increasing our level of technology.

All species are biologically designed to spend most of their existence on the edge of starvation. The fact that human beings, starting around 1800, were the first species to permanently escape this condition, needs a profound answer based on man’s unique nature, his ability to reason.

  
  

  
  

  
  

## Philosophical Foundations of Carl Menger

  
  

There has been a lot of interest in the philosophical foundations of Carl Menger. Many Objectivist writers have emphasized Menger’s Aristotelian training, while others have suggested that Menger’s ideas align with Kant and Popper. Most scholars agree that Franz Brentano, who was an Austrian Philosopher, had a big influence on Menger.

Carl Menger was an Aristotelian although not a pure one. He read Aristotle and studied the works of Franz Brentano (1838-1917), a contemporary of Menger at the University of Vienna, who taught Aristotelian philosophy there. Brentano has been considered to be the leading Austrian philosopher of the late nineteenth century.

In order to obtain a better understanding of Menger’s philosophy, it is important to understand Franz Brentano’s philosophical ideas. Brentano’s work focused mainly on the philosophy of psychology. Sigmund Freud was his student and highly influence by Brentano.[170](#sdfootnote170sym)

Brentano argued that philosophy should be scientifically rigorous, as rigorous as the natural sciences.[171](#sdfootnote171sym) However, Marx and many others have said they were doing science also.

He emphasized that all our knowledge should be based on direct experience. He did not hold, however, that this experience needs to be made from a third-person point of view, and thus opposes what has become a standard of empirical science nowadays. Brentano rather argued a form of introspectionism: doing psychology from an empirical standpoint means for him to describe what one directly experiences in inner perception, from a first-person point of view.[172](#sdfootnote172sym)

This passage starts strong with knowledge based on direct experience, but then shifts making the observer part of the experiment and then it redefines empirical to mean “inner perception”. This inner perception is the means to absolute truths according to Brentano.

Brentano argues, “that they (mental phenomena) are only perceived in inner consciousness, while in the case of physical phenomena only external perception is possible” (Psychology, 91). According to Brentano, the former of these two forms of perception provides an unmistakable evidence for what is true.

Brentano says that it (inner perception) is the only kind of perception in a strict sense.[173](#sdfootnote173sym)

According to Webster’s Dictionary, science is “knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation.” By observation, Webster’s does not mean inner perception. While Einstein was famous for his “thought experiments”, they were a way of conceptualizing a problem in physics. They were not actual experiments nor did they substitute for actual experiments. Brentano is not doing or proposing to do science, despite his statement.

Brentano is widely regarded as Aristotelian and studied Aristotle extensively. He also was fascinated with the Scholastics and Descartes, but disliked Kant and the German idealists.[174](#sdfootnote174sym) Brentano and Aristotle appear to agree on Universals, which Piekoff explained as:

Universals, he (Aristotle) holds, are merely aspects of existing entities, isolated in thought by a process of selective attention; they have no existence apart from particulars. Reality is comprised, not of Platonic abstractions, but of concrete, individual entities, each with a definite nature, each obeying the laws inherent in its nature. Aristotle’s universe is the universe of science. The physical world, in his view, is not a shadowy projection controlled by a divine dimension, but an autonomous, self-sufficient realm. It is an orderly, intelligible, natural realm, open to the mind of man.[175](#sdfootnote175sym)

Brentano’s rejection of Platonic abstractions may have accounted for his distaste for Kant.

Despite the appearance of agreement with Aristotle on metaphysics, Brentano’s position in epistemology significantly differs from Aristotle. Brentano rejects that our senses are how we initially obtain knowledge about the world.

In fact he maintained that external, sensory perception could not tell us anything about the de facto existence of the perceived world, which could simply be illusion. However, we can be absolutely sure of our internal perception. When I hear a tone, I cannot be completely sure that there is a tone in the real world, but I am absolutely certain that I do hear. This awareness, of the fact that I hear, is called internal perception.

External perception, sensory perception, can only yield hypotheses about the perceived world, but not truth. Hence he and many of his pupils (in particular Carl Stumpf and Edmund Husserl) thought that the natural sciences could only yield hypotheses and never universal, absolute truths as in pure logic or mathematics.

Franz Brentano maintained that our senses were invalid and could not tell us anything about the world. [176](#sdfootnote176sym)

This is the exact opposite of Aristotle.

[H]e (Aristotle) thinks that we can and do have knowledge, so that somehow we begin in sense perception and build up to an understanding of the necessary and invariant features of the world. This is the knowledge featured in genuine science (epistêmê).

Brentano and Aristotle are completely opposite on one of the most fundamental points of epistemology. Because this issue is foundational, it will affect everything else the two men have to say on science and philosophy. I think it is a mistake to argue that Brentano was Aristotelian.

With this background this paper will examine Menger’s epistemological positions. Menger lays out his epistemology in a book entitled _Investigations into the Method of Social Sciences_.[177](#sdfootnote177sym) Lawrence H. White in the introduction to the book, explains.

Fortunately, Menger draws and even emphasizes a suitable distinction between the "realist-empirical orientation of theoretical research" and the "exact" orientation (p. 59). The search for so-called, ”exact laws” alone is more appropriately considered the task of purely theoretical research in economics. We can make sense of "exact laws" as theoretical propositions which (necessarily) take an "if-then" form: if conditions A and B hold, then condition C must also obtain. Menger rightly insists (pp. 70, 215) that realist-empirical generalizations (e.g., A and B are usually accompanied by C) can by their nature never attain the strictness that necessarily characterizes logical implications. The two sorts of "laws" are on different epistemological planes. So without too much dissent from Menger's thought we may divide economic theory from economic history where he divided strict theory from what he considered an empirical sort of theory. What is empirical is really historical, and this accounts for its different status from what is deductive.[178](#sdfootnote178sym)

Lawrence H. White goes on to explain:

But this is not because, like some economists, he (Menger) sees empiricism or positivism or falsificationism as the only proper method for both social science and natural science. Instead he argues (p. 59 n. 18) that both the search for empirical regularities and the formulation of non-empirical, non-falsifiable ("exact") theories are methods common to both economics and such natural science fields as chemistry. In viewing theoretical research in every field as having a non-empirical proposition at its core, Menger's position bears some resemblance to that of modern philosophers of science. [179](#sdfootnote179sym)

Menger is arguing that science involves a theoretical side that is impervious to empirical data. This sounds a lot like Brentano’s idea of “inner perception”, which “provides an unmistakable evidence for what is true.” Menger says there is a second side of economics (science) which is empirical and never provides “exact” true theories in economics or science generally. This is very similar to the explanation of Brentano’s ideas on empirical evidence: “External perception, sensory perception, can only yield hypotheses about the perceived world, but not truth.”[180](#sdfootnote180sym)

Brentano’s and Menger’s ideas match up fairly well. Neither of their positions fit Aristotle’s epistemological ideas. Both of them have misappropriated the word science. In science reality is always the final judge. There is nothing that man knows that did not start with our perceptions and nothing in science that is “exactly true”, i.e., independent of empirical observation.

While Bentano and Menger appear to be opposed to Kant, their epistemological positions are a lot closer to Kant than Aristotle. Menger’s theoretical-empirical split fits Kant’s noumenal and phenomenal realm when translated to epistemology, which results in the analytic-synthetic distinction. “Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.”[181](#sdfootnote181sym)

Menger and Brentano’s empirical side is a precursor to Karl Popper’s mistaken ideas on science. Popper appeared to accept David Hume’s skepticism of induction and his response is the same as Menger’s and Brentano’s, which is that empirical evidence never gives us the truth, just closer approximations. This is not the philosophy of science and is based in-part on an incorrect understanding of what knowledge is. Knowledge does not mean being omniscient or having “perfect knowledge”. It is impossible to gain knowledge by just thinking about things (Without reference to the reality).

Menger’s ideas are inconsistent with objectivism. They undermine science and economics.

  
  

  
  

## Carl Menger: Austrian Economics vs. Objectivism

  
  

Carl Menger is commonly considered the founder of Austrian economics. Menger wrote his first book _Principles of Economics_ in 1871. It is very difficult to nail down Menger’s position on a number of issues. For instance, he is known for developing the subjective theory of value in Austrian economics, which was in response to the labor theory of value of classical economics. The labor theory of value is that the value of an item is equal to the value of all the labor that went into making the item. This is an intrinsic theory of value and rejected by almost all economists today. However, many people including some Objectivists argue that Menger really was advocating an objective theory of value instead of a subjective theory of value.

For instance, consider these two quotes by Menger from _Principles of Economics:_

  
  

Value is thus the importance that individual goods or quantities of goods attain for us because we are conscious of being dependent on command of them for the satisfaction of our needs. p. 115 (objective?)

The measure of value **is entirely subjective in nature**, and for this reason a good can have great value to one economizing individual, little value to another, and no value at all to a third, depending upon the differences in their requirements and available amounts. What one person disdains or values lightly is appreciated by another, and what one person abandons is often picked up by another. P. 146 (subjective?)

  
  

Modern Austrians and most economists today have accepted the subjective theory of values. The logical result of accepting the subjective theory of values is that no rational theory of ethics is possible, which is exactly what Mises, Hayek, modern Austrians and modern economists, such as Milton Friedman, have concluded. This means that Natural Rights and Rand’s ethics are inconsistent with the subjective theory of values. This has important implications particularly for property rights, but in fact makes all of law subjective.

Despite the contradictory statements by Menger I think it is fair to say that he was advocating a subjective theory of values. Menger was most influenced by philosopher Franz Brentano who also was highly influential of Freud. Franz Brentano maintained that our senses were invalid and could not tell us anything about the world.[182](#sdfootnote182sym) In addition, the Austrians who follow and praised Menger have adopted the subjective theory of value.

Another question that arises is whether Menger’s epistemology was reason or consistent with science and Objectivism. Again you can find contradictory interpretations, even among Objectivist. However, in his book _Principles of Economics_ he is clear that the techniques of the physical sciences at the time were not the ones he was applying in his study of economics. Menger described his epistemology in more detail in his book _Investigations into the Method of Social Sciences,_ where he suggests that all science has a theoretical, non-empirical side and an empirical side.[183](#sdfootnote183sym) The theoretical side creates universal truths that cannot be subject to empirical proof or disproof. That is not science. It appears to me that Mises’ praxeology follows Menger’s theoretical side, which is philosophical rationalism. While Hayek follows the empirical side of Menger, which rejects the efficacy of reason.

Menger’s _Principles of Economics_ provides almost no empirical evidence for his positions. In addition, he shows no interest in the most interesting economic phenomena in history, the Industrial Revolution. This is inconsistent with a scientific approach to economics.

Menger shows only a passing interest in what causes economic growth, particularly per capita increases in wealth. He argues that economic growth is the result of creating more second or high order goods. His explanation appears to be the basis of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory. This is just a long winded way of saying increasing capital goods causes economic growth, which had already been said by many other economists. Not only has this already been said by other economists, but it is wrong.

In conclusion, Menger seems to commonly make contradictory statements, which makes him difficult to pin down, however it appears clear to me that Menger is not consistent with Objectvism on metaphysic, epistemology, or ethics. Menger’s support for “free markets” or capitalism is coincidental with Objectivism, not fundamental.

## Carl Menger: Principles of Economics

  
  

This is a review of Carl Menger’s book [Principles of Economics](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Principles%20of%20Economics_5.pdf) published in 1871[184](#sdfootnote184sym). I will be judging this book on three criteria: 1) Is it adhering to the philosophy of science? 2) Does it address the question of what is the cause of real per capita increases in wealth? and 3) Does it address the question of what was the cause of the industrial revolution? These last two questions are the most important in all of economics and it is impossible to write something that is profound if it does not address a profound question. I will also be analyzing Menger’s “subjective” theory of value and prices.

  
  

**Philosophy of Science**

Menger addresses this issue in the Preface. He discusses the remarkable advances of the hard sciences and the high regard in which they are held. He also laments that economics is held in very low regard.

This method of research, attaining universal acceptance in the natural sciences, led to very great results, and on this account came mistakenly to be called the natural-scientific method. It is, in reality, a method common to all fields of empirical knowledge, and should properly be called the empirical method. The distinction is important because every method of investigation acquires its own specific character from the nature of the field of knowledge to which it is applied. **It would be improper, accordingly, to attempt a natural-scientific orientation of our science.** (P.47)

Menger however never states why it would be improper to use the philosophy of natural sciences. He implies that he is using the “empirical method” however he never explains what he means by that. The rest of the book has almost no empirical evidence in support of Menger’s positions. Menger’s lack of clarity on this point is consistent with much of the rest of the book. This means that it is often possible to argue that Menger held two contrary positions and find support for both in this book. This in and of itself is support that Menger did not follow the philosophy of science, however it is useful rhetorical tool. In addition, his major protégé, Ludwig Von Mises, explicitly rejects the philosophy of science, in favor of philosophical rationalism.

Menger’s major intellectual influence was Franz Brentano, an Austrian philosopher best known for his works related to psychology.[185](#sdfootnote185sym) Brentano wrote a book entitled _Perception is Misception_, in which he claims that perception is erroneous. “In fact he maintained that external, sensory perception could not tell us anything about the de facto existence of the perceived world, which could simply be illusion.”[186](#sdfootnote186sym) Since Menger considered Brentano a friend and intellectual influence and Menger did not refute this position, it is reasonable to assume that Menger was sympathetic to Brentano’s anti-perception idea. This anti-perception point of view is very reminiscent of Plato. Plato’s ideas are not consistent with science.

The overwhelming evidence is that Menger did not follow the philosophy of science. This means that none of the major Austrian economists, Menger, Von Mises, or Hayek based economics on the philosophy science. Austrian economics is not a science.

  
  

**Source of Economic Growth (Menger)**

This section, **The Causes of Progress in Human Welfare** p. 71, is the part of Menger’s book I consider most important. It also appears to be the payoff for pages of description of first, second, third, etc. order goods. Even Menger admits that his definition of these is a bit vague, however first order goods appear to be consumables or consumer goods. Menger argues that economic growth is the result of creating more second or high order goods. This is just a long winded way of saying increasing capital goods causes economic growth, which had already been said by many other economists. Not only has this already been said by other economists, but it is wrong. He also has one throw-away line about human knowledge. “Nothing is more certain than that the degree of economic progress of mankind will still, in future epochs, be commensurate with the degree of progress of human knowledge.” He never builds on this, he does not explore how human knowledge is created, how it results in increases in economic wealth, or what knowledge is important to economic growth. His followers, such as Mises also do not build on this, they all focus on increases in savings and capital as the cause of growth in the economy.

In a technologically stagnant economy adding more capital, at best, can lead to some sort of optimum output, but can never exceed this level. As a simple example, imagine Robinson Crusoe fishing with a spear. The spear is a second order good or higher under Menger’s approach. Now if Crusoe creates more spears will he have more fish? No, since he can only use one spear at a time. At best having more spears will allow him to replace his spear more quickly if he breaks or loses a spear. Another example is that if every farmer that can use a tractor has one, then giving them more tractors will not increase the production of first order goods. This has been shown empirically and Robert Solow’s paper (Solow, Robert M, Technical Change and the Aggregate Production Function, The Review of Economics and Statistics, Vol. 39, No. 3 (Aug., 1957), pp. 312-320) and is just one of many that prove this.

Menger fails to answer the question of what causes real per capita increases in wealth.

  
  

**Industrial Revolution**

Menger never mentions the industrial revolution in this book. The Industrial Revolution is the first time that people escape subsistence living (the Malthusian Trap) in large numbers. It is the most significant event in the economic history of the world and Menger shows no interest in it. By the time Menger wrote _Principles of Economics_ the Industrial Revolution was at least seventy years old and had exploded in the United States. This shows a profound disinterest in the empirical side of economics. It would be like an astronomer ignoring and eschewing the telescope or a biologist who refuses to do or even explore the results of dissections.

Menger does not compare the economies of different countries or the economy of a country at different times, despite the profound differences in the economies of countries around the world. This is not how a scientist thinks or works. Instead Menger examines propositions in his own head, like the monks of the middle ages arguing over how many angels can dance on a pin head. Menger’s style is completely consistent with Mises praxeology – philosophical rationalism.

The cause of real per capita increases in wealth is increasing levels of technology (new inventions) and the cause of the Industrial Revolution is legally enforceable property rights for inventions (patents) as William Rosen, shows in his excellent book [The Most Powerful Idea in the World](http://www.amazon.com/Most-Powerful-Idea-World-Invention-ebook/dp/B0036S49WS/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) and I show in my book [Source of Economic Growth](http://www.amazon.com/Source-Economic-Growth-Dale-Halling-ebook/dp/B00XDAG22E/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1447533964&sr=8-1).

Menger does not discuss inventions, technology, knowledge, patents or their importance in economics. Menger fails to add anything useful to the two most important questions in all of economics.

  
  

**Subjective Value**

Menger is generally credited with the idea of subjective value in economics. This is described as a reaction to the labor theory of value described in classical economics, which is an intrinsic theory of value. Despite this many people have argued that Menger was not advocating a subjective theory of value. Note that when modern Austrians use the term subjective value they mean that values are disconnected from reality – they are peoples’ arbitrary decisions. The interesting thing is that in his Principles of Economics you can find support for both positions. For instance, if you want to argue that Menger was advocating an objective theory of valuation you can provide the following quotes:

Value is thus the importance that individual goods or quantities of goods attain for us because we are conscious of being dependent on command of them for the satisfaction of our needs. p. 115

  
  

Value is therefore nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, but merely the importance that we first attribute to the satisfaction of our needs, that is, to our lives and well-being, and in consequence carry over to economic goods as the exclusive causes of the satisfaction of our needs. p 116

Menger also makes this distinction between real and imaginary goods. He appears to be making a point about objective values, however he never does anything with these concepts once he introduces them.

Note that Menger never defines what he means by needs. Are needs anything someone wants? Menger never says. Then he talks about the satisfaction of needs. Is this a personally, subjective decision? Menger never says.

On the other hand if you want to say Menger was advocating the modern value subjectivism of Austrians, then you can find these quotes.

It is a judgment economizing men make about the importance of the goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and well-being. Hence **value does not exist outside the consciousness of men**. It is, therefore, also quite erroneous to call a good that has value to economizing individuals a “value,” or for economists to speak of “values” as of independent real things, and to objectify value in this way. P. 121

The measure of value **is entirely subjective in nature**, and for this reason a good can have great value to one economizing individual, little value to another, and no value at all to a third, depending upon the differences in their requirements and available amounts. What one person disdains or values lightly is appreciated by another, and what one person abandons is often picked up by another. P. 146

**Hence not only the nature but also the measure of value is subjective**. Goods always have value to certain economizing individuals and this value is also determined only by these individuals. P.146

Another factor favoring the subjective theory of values is that Menger is clear that ethics and morality are outside the study of economics.

But it seems to me that the question of the legal or moral character of these facts is beyond the sphere of our science. P. 173

Here he is talking about the morality of charging interest, however it is clear that this statement is a more general statement about economics. This suggests that Menger’s ethics, like most Austrians, is some version of Utilitarianism, which means he rejects Locke’s and Rand’s Natural Rights. Another quote that supports this point of view is Menger’s ideas of property.

The entire sum of goods at an economizing individual’s command for the satisfaction of his needs, we call his property. His property is not, however, an arbitrarily combined quantity of goods, but a direct reflection of his needs, an integrated whole, no essential part of which can be diminished or increased without affecting realization of the end it serves. P.76

  
  

Property, therefore, like human economy, is not an arbitrary invention but rather the only practically possible solution of the problem that is, in the nature of things, imposed upon us by the disparity between requirements for, and available quantities of, all economic goods. P. 97

The first quote is really Menger’s definition of property. Note that this over 200 years after Locke. It is a clear rejection of Locke and Natural Rights.

The second quote is a forerunner of the inane idea that property “rights” are socially useful tools for allocating scarce resources adhered to by Austrians.

Menger’s position on subjective value is confused. Note that this is not the work of scientist, which shows once again that Menger’s ideas are not based on the philosophy of science. Menger’s rejection Natural Rights, rejection of ethics in economics, and the direction his students took suggests that on balance Menger was an advocate of the radical subjective theory of value.

  
  

**Conclusion**

I undertook this task because a number of people I have respect for argued that Menger was not the same as Hayek or Von Mises. In addition, a number of well-known Objectivists have tried to reconcile Austrian Economics with Objectivism. I have analyzed in depth the irrational roots of the two main branches of Austrian Economics: 1) Hayek and 2) Von Mises. I have shown that the positions of Austrians on a number of positions are absolutely flawed including their position on property “rights”, the Austrian Business Cycle, their position on fractional reserve banking, and their position on intellectual property. Carl Menger has not proven to be the savior of this fall from grace. This is not to say that other schools of economics are better or that there is nothing useful in Austrian economics. For instance, Menger’s marginal utility is a useful concept, but hardly profound.

I found _Principle of Economics_ boring, repetitive, and written in the pseudo-scientific style of many pop management books or psychological self-help books. This is consistent with other books I have read by Austrians. The best writer among the major Austrians is Hayek.

I did not force myself to read every word of _Principle of Economics_ because it is boring, repetitive, and non-scientific. I will not apologize for not reading all of a book that is clearly not based on science.

Objectivism and Austrian economics are incompatible. I think many Objectivists are fooled into supporting Austrian economics because they talk about free markets. Austrian economics is not the product of reason, the Enlightenment, and the philosophy of science. It is best described as a branch of the Scottish “Enlightenment”, which really was a counter enlightenment movement. If Objectivism wants to make progress in economic science it needs to wall itself off from Austrian economics.

  
  

## Mises: Praxeology: An Intellectual Train Wreck

  
  

One of the foremost economists in Austrian Economics is Ludwig Von Mises. One of his major contributions was his idea of human action, which he calls praxeology. I have been trying to better understand praxeology. I have consulted numerous websites, papers, and videos on point. Most of them either ramble on saying nothing or they spend all their time attacking logical positivists or others. I decided to review a [paper](https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics) from the Mises website and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9rBvQG1l0o) on point. Together I thought these were the best sources on slightly different points of praxeology. The video was a lecture by Dr. Walter Block who is the Harold E. Wirth Eminent Scholar Chair in Economics and Professor of Economics at Loyola University New Orleans and Senior Fellow with the Ludwig von Mises Institute. Below are statements from the paper (1-4) and the video (5-12), with my comments below. Note that my criticism of praxeology and Austrian Economics is not an endorsement of any other school of economics including classical, neo-classical, Keynesian, monetarists, etc. The fact that I am critical of praxeology does not make me or mean I am a logical positivist. Also my critique is not to suggest that there are no valid points made by Austrian Economics.

  
  

1) _“Praxeology rests on the fundamental axiom that individual human beings act, that is, on the primordial fact that individuals engage in conscious actions toward chosen goals.”[187](#sdfootnote187sym) “Let us note that praxeology does not assume that a person's choice of values or goals is wise or proper . . . “[188](#sdfootnote188sym)_

How can you tell the difference between non-goal directed action and goal directed action, if you cannot say what goals should be pursued or will be pursued? If the goals are random or allowed to be random, how can you be sure the actions are not random? The answer is that there is no difference between non-goal directed action and goal directed action where the goals are random. This is part of the value subjectivism of Austrian Economics.

What is the goal directed action of a person committing suicide? Or a vandal? Or a teenager on a joy ride?

The human action axiom is meaningless when it is impossible to judge the goal.

  
  

2) _“Apart from the fact that these conclusions cannot be "tested" by historical or statistical means, there is no need to test them since their truth has already been established. Historical fact enters into these conclusions only by determining which branch of the theory is applicable in any particular case.”[189](#sdfootnote189sym)_

_This means that praxeology is a branch of Philosophical Rationalism. Descartes created a system of physics just by thinking about the world. It was internally consistent. In other words it was just like praxeology and it did not describe the world and could not be used to predict or understand how something would work._

  
  

3) “Mathematical logic is appropriate to physics.” But not to economics. “In physics the axioms and therefore the deductions are in themselves purely formal and only acquire meaning "operationally" insofar as they can explain and predict given facts.”[190](#sdfootnote190sym)

There are no axioms in physics. Physics is a science and science starts with observations, not axioms.

  
  

4) “_That Austrian School economics rests firmly from the beginning on an analysis of the fact of individual subjective values and choices.”[191](#sdfootnote191sym)_

Note that the paper says “individual subjective choices”, which means that the word subjective here is not that each person makes their own choices. It means that there is no rational way to evaluate people’s choices. This subjectivism is why all major figures in Austrian Economics do not think that natural rights exist. They do not believe that ethics can be based on reason.

5) _Economics is pure logic – no need to verify in the real world._

That would make economics a branch of mathematics (logic), not a science. (Also see the video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTXxvWa11Lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTXxvWa11Lg)).

  
  

6) _While economics is based on pure logic, the lecturer argues it is science._

Dr. Block does not know what the definition of a science is. Actually, I do not think Mises made this mistake of confusing math/logic with science.

  
  

7_) Total profits equal zero in the economy is an axiomatic (theorem) tendency according to the professor._

If this were true we would still be living in the Malthusian Trap. The definition of zero profit in the economy would mean that on average people are living on the edge of starvation. Profit means that you produce enough to have a surplus. But this does not have to bother Dr. Brock, because economics is not an empirical science, which is an oxymoron.

It appears the professor was attempting to summarize the zero profit theorem, which is based on perfect competition. Perfect competition is a flawed concept that denies property rights, something it has in common with Austrian Economics. I discuss the many flaws of perfect competition in my book [Source of Economic Growth](http://www.amazon.com/Source-Economic-Growth-Dale-Halling/dp/1511829680/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441402708&sr=8-1) (Included as Part 2 of this book).

If what the Austrians are trying to say is “in a technologically stagnant economy the total profits tend to zero.” Then that is true as discussed in Part 2 of the book. The reason for this is the second law of thermodynamics (entropy). It is also probably true in a technologically stagnant market, profits tend to zero for firms in the market.

  
  

8) _The Zero Profit theorem cannot be falsified according to the good Doctor._

That is the meaning of non-empirical, but what is amazing is that he says this straight up and I showed above that the theorem as he states it is in fact incorrect.

  
  

9) _You don’t test that a triangle has 180 degrees?_

Yes you do. Obviously the doctor is not familiar with the book flatlanders. In fact there is an experiment in astronomy that is doing exactly this. See [http://www.mathaware.org/mam/05/shape.of.universe.html](http://www.mathaware.org/mam/05/shape.of.universe.html).

  
  

10) _The doctor is using econometric modeling. Econometrics assumes that economics is empirical. The doctor is correct to criticize logical positivism, but logical positivism is not a correct philosophy of science. (Also see the video_ [_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTXxvWa11Lg_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTXxvWa11Lg)_)_

  
  

11) _Trade – both parties expect to profit by a trade is an axiom/theorem of praxeology according to the doctor._

While this is true, it violates the zero profit tendency.

  
  

12) _Inputs to the economy are land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurs._

How are entrepreneurs a separate input? Are not entrepreneurs just a combination of people and capital, at least in Austrian Economics?

The additional input and the only input of importance is human knowledge and when we are talking about economics that means inventions.

  
  

Conclusion

I only commented on the first 15 minutes or so of the video. There were other errors, but explaining them would take too long. Of course there were many valid points.

The bottom line is that praxeology is not a science and to the extent that Austrian Economics is based on praxeology it is not a science. Block points out that there are sort of two schools of Austrian Economics and the other one is based on Hayek’s ideas. Hayek rejected praxeology and his somewhat equivalent theory is his theory of Cultural Evolution. Cultural Evolution is an inherently collectivist idea that is based on the idea that reason is limited or total ineffectual. It is not a science either, since it rejects the use of reason. No matter which branch of Austrian Economics that you investigate it is not a science. The result is that it makes numerous errors, which I are detailed in a later chapter, but include an improper definition of property rights, an improper definition of capitalism, the false model of the Austrian Business Cycle, and others.

Austrian Economics is not the only school of economics that is not a science. However, if economics is to ever advance it has to be a science based on the nature of man and understanding his unique tool of survival is his ability to reason.

  
  

  
  

## Mises: Austrian Economics and Aristotle

  
  

Austrian Economics is always claiming a strong connection to the Philosophy of Aristotle. The Austrians main connection to Aristotle is the idea of apriorism. In philosophy apriorism is defined as the philosophical doctrine that there may be genuine knowledge independent of experience. This apriorism shows up particularly in Menger and Mises. In Mises’ case it is clearly related to his ideas on praxeology. In Menger’s case this comes from his epistemology in which he states there is an exact theoretical side of science and an inexact empirical side of science. The question is whether the Austrians’ claim to following Aristotle’s ideas or being neo-Aristotelian has any validity?

One of the most defining points of Aristotle’s philosophy was his disagreement with Plato’s “Theory of Forms.” Plato argued that we cannot trust our senses and the world they perceive is at best a vague, shadowy version of the real world. For more see [Plato’s Allegory of the Cave](https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/cave.htm). According to Plato if you see a red ball there is a perfect version of red and a perfect version of a ball in the “real world” and we are seeing some sort of distorted versions of these. Plato’s real world is often represented as being up in the sky, sort of a heaven. Since we cannot trust our senses, Plato’s answer is that we must think about what has to be true and that will lead us to the truth. This is known as rationalism.

Aristotle rejected Plato’s ideas and said we could trust our senses. In order to verify (and integrate) that our conclusions from our senses are valid Aristotle created rules of thought or logic. It is important to remember that to Aristotle these conclusions were always based on (tested against) the real world evidence. In other words, logic was useful in reasoning about the world, but the ultimate proof was reality. This makes him diametrically opposed to Plato’s rationalism.

There is a famous painting entitled _The School of Athens_ by Raphael in which Plato is pointing to the sky and Aristotle has his hand out pointing to the world before us that illustrates the differences between Aristotle and Plato. Aristotle’s epistemology is based in this world, where Plato thinks that the real world is in the heavens.

How did Austrians ever get the idea that apriorism is consistent with Aristotle? A search of Aristotle on the _Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy of Philosophy_ and the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ does not show any mentions of apriorism or apriori and Aristotle. An informal search of academic papers and books finds only a couple of mentions of Aristotle and apriorism, except by Austrians (Austrian/Objectivists). A couple of these papers argue that apriorism is inconsistent with Aristotle’s philosophy. One book says that Aristotle the empiricist exposes the vanity of armchair natural scientists and it is clear that Aristotle lies on the side of empiricism not apriorism.[192](#sdfootnote192sym)

This idea that apriorism is consistent with Aristotle appears to come from Aristotle’s concept of axioms. Aristotle had one axiom, the principle of non-contradiction according the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The explanation (justification) of this axiom sounds similar to the Austrians apriorism.

“Before embarking on this study of substance, however, Aristotle goes on in Book Γ to argue that first philosophy, the most general of the sciences, must also address the most fundamental principles—the common axioms—that are used in all reasoning. Thus, first philosophy must also concern itself with the principle of non-contradiction (PNC): the principle that “the same attribute cannot at the same time belong and not belong to the same subject and in the same respect” (1005b19). This, Aristotle says, is the most certain of all principles, and it is not just a hypothesis. It cannot, however, be proved, since it is employed, implicitly, in all proofs, no matter what the subject matter. It is a first principle, and hence is not derived from anything more basic.  
  
  

What, then, can the science of first philosophy say about the PNC? It cannot offer a proof of the PNC, since the PNC is presupposed by any proof one might offer—any purported proof of the PNC would therefore be circular.”[193](#sdfootnote193sym)

  
  

This axiom was expanded to three axioms, the law of identity, the law of the non-contradiction, and the law of the excluded middle. It seems to me that the other two laws follow from the law of identity.

This sounds similar to how Austrians justify their apriorism, however the Austrians extend the idea to state:

(a) that the fundamental axioms and premises of economics are absolutely true;

(b) that the theorems and conclusions deduced by the laws of logic from these postulates are therefore absolutely true;

(c) that there is consequently no need for empirical “testing,” either of the premises or the conclusions; and

(d) that the deduced theorems could not be tested even if it were desirable.[194](#sdfootnote194sym)

While this was written by Murray Rothbard it is the logical conclusion of Menger’s “theoretical science.” These ideas are diametrically opposed to those of Aristotle. Austrian Economics is not Aristotelian, not science and not consistent with Objectivism.

  
  

## Hayek: Friend or Foe of Reason, Liberty and Capitalism?

  
  

I have been accused of taking the Austrian School of Economics out of context. Rather than range all over the topic, I will address one Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek, primarily with respect to his epistemology. However, his sense of ethics follows directly from his epistemology so this will be discussed. As well, his metaphysics will be touched on.

My criteria of whether Hayek is a friend or foe will primarily focus on whether he is an advocate for reason (logic and evidence) as best defined by Rand and Locke. I focus primarily on Hayek’s Theory of Cultural Evolution, which lays out his ideas on epistemology. There are dozens of papers on this subject and below I will provide quotes from a number of papers that analyze Hayek’s theory.

  
  

Austrian economist, political philosopher, and winner of the 1974 Nobel memorial prize –[Hayek] spent a good part of his career developing a theory of cultural evolution. _According to this theory, rules, norms and practices evolve in a process of natural selection operating at_ _**the level of the group**_. Thus, groups that happen to have more efficient rules and practices tend to grow, multiply, and ultimately displace other groups. The theory, of which _Hayek himself was proud, is on all accounts central to his economic, social, and political project._ In the present paper, I explore the history of this theory of cultural evolution.

The History of Hayek’s Theory of Cultural Evolution, Erik Angner, Dept. of History and Philosophy of Science

  
  

It is clear from the quote above that ethics is at a group level, not at the individual level. The ethics of a group are random and the dominate ethical rules are determined by some sort of evolutionary success. According to the paper this is not a side issue or something Hayek scribbled out that is separate from the rest of his ideas.

It is hard to believe that Rand or Locke would have been impressed with the idea that ethics are determined by the success of groups.

  
  

  
  

According to Hayek, _reason was not the driving force behind cultural evolution, but rather co-evolved in the course of this process_. (Emphasis Added)

Hayek’s Theory of Cultural Evolution a Critique of the Critiques, by Horst Feldmann

  
  

This paper suggests that reason is the result of cultural evolution just like ethics. It is hard to see Rand or Locke agreeing with this.

  
  

Hayek argues, however, that the demand for rational, conscious ("political") control of the concrete particulars of social life is based upon a misunderstanding of the process of cultural evolution and on a _hubristic and dangerous overestimation of the capacity of the conscious reasoning intellect._ _As we have seen, Hayek contends that civilization is not the creation of the reasoning mind, but the unintended outcome of the spontaneous play of innumerable minds within a_ _**matrix of nonrational values, beliefs, and traditions.**_ The desire of modern constructivists to "make everything subject to rational control" represents for Hayek an egregious **"abuse of reason" based upon a failure to recognize the limits to reason's sphere of competence**.63 Such limits, again, stem from the fact that reason is confronted by an immovable epistemological barrier: its irremediable ignorance of most of the particular, concrete facts that determine the actions of individuals within society. **The constructivist's main error is the refusal to recognize that reason is only competent in the realm of the abstract.** Hayek observes that the "rationalist . . . revolt against reason is . . . usually directed against the abstractness of thought [and] against the submission to abstract rules" and is marked by a passionate embrace of the concrete. He sums up the constructivist error in this way: "**constructivist rationalism rejects the demand for the discipline of reason** because it deceives itself that reason can directly master all particulars; and it is thereby led to a preference for the concrete over the abstract, the particular over the general, because its adherents do not realize how much they thereby limit the span of true control by reason."64 (Emphasis Added)

Hayek on the Role of Reason in Human Affairs, Linda C. Raeder, Palm Beach Atlantic University

  
  

“Matrix of nonrational values, beliefs, and traditions” are responsible for civilization? It is clear that Hayek does not think there is anything special about Natural Rights or the United States or any other country or their values. The most we can say is that it is the best based on its success at this time.

“Rejects the demand for the disciple of reason”? This sounds like it comes straight from an environmentalist or a modern socialist. It is clear that Hayek is not just talking about the limits of the knowledge of a central planner, he is attacking reason itself. The best possible spin is that Hayek is only attacking reason with respect to knowledge of human affairs, i.e., economics, social sciences, ethics, law, political structures, literature and the arts.

It is clear from Hayek’s rejection of reason that he does not agree with an Aristotelian or Objectivist idea of an objective reality that is knowable. At best Hayek’s metaphysics is consistent with Plato’s theory of forms, where we can only get a vague glimpse of reality.

  
  

"The picture of man as a being who, thanks to his reason, can rise above the values of civilization, in order to judge it from the outside . . . is an illusion."83 For Hayek, morals, values, and reason are entirely natural phenomena, evolutionary adaptations which have enabled man to survive and flourish in his particular kind of world.

Hayek on the Role of Reason in Human Affairs, Linda C. Raeder, Palm Beach Atlantic University

  
  

Does the first sentence above sound like Howard Roark or Ellsworth Toohey? Hayek is pushing the worst sort of collectivism. It is a collectivist attack on the mind itself, on the independence of the mind based on reason. Hayek would have stood hand and hand with the Catholic Church in condemning Galileo to death.

  
  

For Hayek, _the rules of morality and justice are the same as they were for David Hume: conventions_ that have emerged and endured because they smooth the coordination of human affairs and are indispensable, given the nature of reality and the circumstances of human existence, to the effective functioning of society. **For Hayek as for Hume the rules of morality and justice are not the products of reason** and they cannot be rationally justified in the way demanded by constructivist thinkers. And since our moral traditions cannot be rationally justified in accordance with the demands of reason or the canons of science, we must be content with the more modest effort of "rational reconstruction," a "natural-historical" investigation of how our institutions came into being, which can enable us to understand the needs they serve.88

Morality is not based on reason according to Hayek, it is based on convention. David Hume was the philosopher that came up with the ‘is-ought” problem in ethics that is the basis for moral relativism. Solving the “is-ought” problem was one of the major accomplishments Rand’s ethics.

Hume also attacked cause and effect and therefore reason, arguing that the best we can say about events is that they are closely related or probabilistic. I consider Hume worse than Kant, partly because he is more understandable than Kant and because he inspired Kant. Here is what Rand had to say about Hume. “If you observe that ever since Hume and Kant (mainly Kant, because Hume was merely the Bertrand Russell of his time) philosophy has been striving to prove that man’s mind is impotent, that there’s no such thing as reality and we wouldn’t be able to perceive it if there were—you will realize the magnitude of the treason involved.”

  
  

Here is quote suggesting Hayek is responsible for bringing Hume into the libertarian movement:

  
  

F.A. Hayek was the chief conduit through which Hume’s moral, political, and social theory entered the mainstream of modern libertarian thought. In his article “The Legal and Political Philosophy of David Hume” (originally presented as a lecture at the University of Freiburg on July 18, 1963), Hayek bemoaned the fact that Hume’s legal and political philosophy had been “curiously neglected.” In addition to being “one of the founders of economic theory” and the greatest British legal philosopher before Bentham, Hume “gives us probably the only comprehensive statement of the legal and political philosophy which later became known as [classical] liberalism.”

[http://www.libertarianism.org/columns/self-interest-social-order-classical-liberalism-david-hume](http://www.libertarianism.org/columns/self-interest-social-order-classical-liberalism-david-hume) Self-Interest and Social Order in Classical Liberalism: David Hume, by George Smith, formerly Senior Research Fellow for the Institute for Humane Studies, a lecturer on American History for Cato Summer Seminars, and Executive Editor of Knowledge Products. Smith's fourth book, The System of Liberty, was recently published by Cambridge University Press.

  
  

This clearly shows that David Hume was a big part of Hayek’s philosophical background. Bentham is Jeremy Bentham, who is considered the father of utilitarianism and is known for being an intellectual father of the utopian socialist movement in England.

  
  

  
  

Perhaps no other area of Burke’s and Hayek’s thought is as congruent as their understanding of the role of reason in human affairs; their views are so close as to suggest that Hayek’s thought on this issue is merely an elaboration, although quite an extensive one, of Burke’s theme. Hayek developed several of Burke’s most crucial insights: _1) the priority of social experience (or "tradition") over reason; 2) the notion that inherited social institutions embody a "superindividual wisdom"_ _which transcends that available to the conscious reasoning mind; and 3) the impotence of reason to ‘design’ a viable social order_.

[http://www.nhinet.org/raeder.htm](http://www.nhinet.org/raeder.htm) The Liberalism/Conservatism Of Edmund Burke and F. A. Hayek:A Critical Comparison, Linda C. Raeder is Associate Editor of HUMANITAS and a Research Associate at the National Humanities Institute

  
  

Here is another attack on reason, an appeal to collective reasoning and another statement that reason is impotent.

  
  

Burke and Hayek, then, shared a common enemy as well as a common understanding: Enlightenment rationalism. Perhaps the most characteristic attribute of Enlightenment thought was its cavalier dismissal of ‘irrational’ tradition as mere superstition and prejudice.

[http://www.nhinet.org/raeder.htm](http://www.nhinet.org/raeder.htm) The Liberalism/Conservatism Of Edmund Burke and F. A. Hayek:A Critical Comparison, Linda C. Raeder is Associate Editor of HUMANITAS and a Research Associate at the National Humanities Institute

  
  

This statement makes it clear that Hayek was anti-reason and anti-enlightenment.

  
  

Hayek, by contrast, is a critic of what he calls ―constructive rationalism. His concept of rationalism is somewhat idiosyncratic, and is not equivalent to Rand‘s conception of reason. _Nevertheless, it leads him to claim that ―no universally valid system of ethics can ever be known to us, which is obviously not consistent with her view._ For Hayek, moral rules have a status lying ―between instinct and reason. (Emphasis Added)

This is another case discussing how Hayek did not think that ethics were based on reason or that reason could ever tell us anything about ethics.

  
  

This case for market freedom is essentially negative. Hayek seems to think that if socialist planning were possible, socialism might be the morally ideal system. But the inescapable ignorance of would-be planners excludes that possibility: ―If there were omniscient men, if we could know not only all that affects the attainment of our present wishes but also our future wants and desires, there would be little case for liberty.‖10

Hayek is not pro-liberty, at best he is pro-tradition, which is why it is not surprising to see so many religious people affiliated with the Austrian School of Economics. He is anti-reason and specifically bases his justification for ‘free markets’ on the limitations of reason generally and on the inability of reason to create or understand morals. His defense of the pricing mechanism of free markets is based not on liberty but on the idea of spontaneous order. More fundamentally, Hayek bases his justification of the pricing mechanism on tradition and utilitarian grounds.

Hayek’s metaphysics appear to be Platonic, which is incompatible with Rand and Locke. His epistemology is more consistent with Hume or Kant than Rand or Locke. You might argue that Hayek was only discussing the limits of reason with regard to social sciences, however at the least he applies it to all areas of human interaction, which includes ethics, the law, and the political realm. This means he is against Natural Rights and Locke, which means he is against capitalism. Capitalism is the economic system that arises when the law protects people’s natural rights, particularly their property rights. Hayek does not recognize property rights, at best he recognizes societies’ property conventions, which means he cannot understand capitalism. This is more than enough for me to damn Hayek as an enemy of capitalism and a foe.

In my opinion, Hayek’s esteem of Hume, Bentham, and Burke point to a much deeper antipathy to reason. His ethics is essentially majority rules with the modifier of natural selection. He specifically thinks it is the most absurd folly to think any one person can use reason to judge a society. This is consistent with his intellectual compatriots Hume and Burke. Hayek’s ethics is perfectly consistent with the moral relativists that say we cannot judge and an ISIS or a USSR or christianity. His ethics are antithetical to Rand’s and Locke’s. Hayek is clear that he does not think Natural Rights can be justified by reason and that Natural Rights cannot claim any special place in the world. Hayek is not a friend of reason, liberty, or capitalism. Rand’s estimation of Hayek is similar to mine, although I think I have spent much more time analyzing the issue.

  
  

## Schumpeter: Innovation vs. Invention

  
  

I think there is a lot of confusion regarding the difference between invention and innovation. This confusion is the result of erroneous definitions and the purposeful intent of some to increase their importance by belittling the contributions of others.

I believe that most of this mischief started with the great economist Joseph Schumpter. According to Wikipedia:

Following Schumpeter (1934), contributors to the scholarly literature on innovation typically distinguish between invention, an idea made manifest, and innovation, ideas applied successfully in practice.

There is nothing inherently wrong with the distinction above, but the way it is applied blurs together a number of different skills. Blurring skills together shows a misunderstanding of the process of innovating. Broadly speaking, innovation can be broken into two distinct sets of skills: creation and dissemination. By creation I mean creating something new, not production – creating something old.

A subset of creation is invention. An invention is a creation with an objective repeatable result. A creation that is not an invention has a subjective result, such as the effect of a painting on a viewer, or the effect of a book on a reader. Many activities combine both a subjective creation and an invention, such as architecture. However, we can separate out the invention from the other creative elements and this helps our understanding of the process.

Dissemination may include a number of processes, such as education (marketing, sales), manufacturing, finance, and management. This is not to say that marketing cannot be creative, it clearly often is very creative. However, the creative part of marketing can be separated out from the dissemination or execution part of marketing. The same is true of manufacturing, which can definitely include inventing. But an invention related to manufacturing is part of the creation step not part of the dissemination step.

Finance can also have inventions. For instance, the invention of a fractional reserve banking is clearly an invention. It has the objective result of securitizing assets and turning them into loans and currency. A fractional reserve bank will securitize land and turn into a loan and currency. Despite this, it is important to understand that the first person to develop the fractional reserve bank is inventing and the person operating the fractional reserve bank is disseminating.

All real per capita economic progress is the result of inventing. This is not to say that it is unnecessary to disseminate inventions, but **if there were no new inventions there would not be any economic progress.** We would be stuck in static world once all the inventions had been completely disseminated. Of course, if we stop all dissemination activities we will quickly starve to death.

It is my belief that business and economic professors have focused on “innovation” instead of “invention” because they have no idea how to invent or how the process of inventing works. They concentrate on what they know, i.e. business and economic practices. As a result, the focus is dissemination, under-appreciating the importance of inventing. In addition, it results in misleading business theories, such as:

– **Management teams are more important than the quality of the invention.**

– **Execution is everything; patents and other IP do not matter.**

– **Get Big Fast.**

The truth-test of these rules of thumb is directly related to the strength of the patent laws at the time the company is created. When patent laws are weak, these rules are more true and when patent laws are strong, these rules are less true. Unfortunately, when patent laws are weak these theories do not overcome the disincentive to invest in risky new technologies. **Management teams do not build revolutionary or disruptive technologies, they just disseminate these technologies.** These sorts of teams are like large companies and generally can produce a return with less risk by NOT developing high-risk technologies. They tend to focus on incremental technologies or on stealing someone else’s technology. While this may be good business advice in a period of weak patents, it is bad for our country’s competitiveness and our standard of living.

Technological progress (i.e., inventing), in the long run, is the only competitive business advantage. The best management team in the world selling buggy whips at the turn of the century could not overcome the technological advance of the automobile and stay a buggy whip company. The best management team in the world selling vacuum tubes in the 1940s, could not overcome the advance of transistors and semiconductors and stay a vacuum tube company. This country is littered with companies that had great management teams that were overwhelmed by changes in technology. For instance, Digital Computers had a great management team, but they could not overcome the advance of the personal computer. Digital Computers failed to invent fast enough to overcome the onslaught of small inexpensive computers. US steel was not able to overcome the onslaught of mini-mills, aluminum, and plastics. This was not because they did not have a good management team, it was because the management team under- prioritized invention and over-prioritized execution or dissemination skills. Ford & GM have not become walking zombies because they did not have strong management teams, but because they have not invented. As a result, they have antiquated production systems and weak technology in their products. 86% of the companies in the Fortune 500 in 1959 are no longer there. Some of these companies disappeared because of bad management, but **most companies disappeared because they did not keep up with changing technology** In other words, they did not invent.

Inventions or advances in technology are the ONLY WAY to increase real per capita incomes and the only long term business advantage. Business school theories that do not prioritize invention, are bad business and bad for our country.

  
  

  
  

## Can “Dignity” Explain the Industrial Revolution: A Review of Deirdre McCloskey’s Economic Ideas

  

Dr. McCloskey is a Distinguished Professor of Economics, History, English, and Communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Her ideas on what caused the Industrial Revolution and economic growth are being widely touted. She has written a number of books ([Bourgeois Equality](http://www.amazon.com/Bourgeois-Equality-Capital-Institutions-Enriched-ebook/dp/B01D9WANCA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1461687049&sr=1-1), [Bourgeois Dignity](http://www.amazon.com/Bourgeois-Dignity-Cato-Unbound-102010-ebook/dp/B007OZUBY4/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1461687185&sr=1-2), and [The Bourgeois Virtues](http://www.amazon.com/Bourgeois-Virtues-Ethics-Age-Commerce/dp/0226556646/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1461687185&sr=1-3)) explaining her position in detail.

McCloskey’s work focuses on the causes of the Industrial Revolution. She does an excellent job of debunking the idea that capital accumulation or exploitation is the cause of the Industrial Revolution. She has a keen grasp of economic history. Unfortunately, the ability to criticize other ideas is not the same thing as putting forth a coherent theory.

This article is based on a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCLfai3kWoU) that McCloskey gave at George Mason, an i[nterview](http://themendenhall.com/2016/04/24/notes-deirdre-mccloskey-mercatus/) that she gave after this talk, and a [review](http://www.artdiamond.com/DiamondPDFs/McCloskeyBourgeiosDignityReviewH.pdf) of her book _Bourgeois Dignity: Why Economics Can't Explain the Modern World_ by Arthur M. Diamond, Jr. a professor of economics from University of Nebraska at Omaha.

One of the most enduring myths of economics is that increases in capital[195](#sdfootnote195sym) are responsible for our increasing standard of living. McCloskey shows that for almost all of human history the average person lived at a subsistence level (edge of starvation aka “the Malthusian Trap”). She cites two exceptions, the Agricultural Revolution that occurred about 10-11 thousand years ago in the Fertile Crescent and the Industrial Revolution. The increase in real per capita incomes that happened after the beginning of the Agricultural Revolution did not last. According to McCloskey the reason it did not last was because human population expanded to absorb the excess calories that were initially created by the Agricultural Revolution.

The Industrial Revolution was the first time in history that average peoples’ incomes began to grow consistently. In the U.S. we have incomes that are 100 times greater than that of people before the Industrial Revolution and across the World as a whole our incomes are 30 times larger than people living at a subsistence level. McCloskey stresses that capital increases cannot explain this increase in our wealth.[196](#sdfootnote196sym) At best it could explain a factor of 2 or 3.

She also argues that “property rights” cannot explain the Industrial Revolution.

Though property rights are important, she noted, Genghis Khan enforced property rights rigidly, and as a result people fled to his domain for its political protections; nonetheless, little in the way of an industrial revolution resulted. China likewise had a good property rights system for centuries without innovation, indicating that it is clearly not a sufficient condition by itself.

Property rights, she said, are “commonplace” without progress, though they are important if progress is to be had.[197](#sdfootnote197sym)

McCloskey also argues that scientific progress is not the cause of this increase in wealth.

[T]he Scientific Revolution did not suffice. Non‐ Europeans like the Chinese outstripped the West in science until quite late. Britain did not lead in science—yet clearly did in technology. Indeed, applied technology depended on science only a little even in 1900.[198](#sdfootnote198sym)

So what did cause this explosion in wealth associated with the Industrial Revolution according to McCloskey? Innovation. She does not define exactly what she means by innovation. It clearly includes invention, however like Schumpeter she sees inventors as just a small part of the overall puzzle. According to a reviewer, McCloskey thinks invention is on autopilot.

She expresses the view that since roughly 1900 the process of invention has become “routine” which would also be consistent with a view that patents are not necessary. (footnote 9 on p. 454)[199](#sdfootnote199sym)

She also dismisses the patent system as the cause of this increase in wealth and innovation. However, professor Arthur M. Diamond, Jr. suggests her argument in unconvincing.

I also have one substantive concern. McCloskey rejects a little too quickly and a little too strongly one important possible cause: patents.[200](#sdfootnote200sym)

The answer for McCloskey is liberty and dignity. In various places she says this is key for inventors, or innovators (Schumpter), or Bourgeois virtues. It is hard to see how this leads to any specific policies or even how you can measure the dignity portion of her answer. While her critique of standard economics is brilliant and she is focused on the right questions, her answers are confused and contradictory.

For instance, in some places she emphasizes invention not social attitudes and in other places she says inventions just occur and inventors are unimportant. She never explains why the Industrial Revolution starts in Great Britain and the U.S. but not in France for instance. She does point out that it is not scientific advancement, because France was at least if not more scientifically advanced than Great Britain at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

McCloskey hints that she is sympathetic to the Austrian School of Economics. For instance, in the talk at George Mason she says “economics is what goes on between our ears.” She emphasizes her agreement with the Austrian’s radical subjectivism when she says “its subjective value all the way down” and “we can’t be sure that people experience red the same as us.”

Despite this she seems to align with Joseph Schumpeter more than she does with Mises or Hayek. Her critique of the capital theory of wealth creation is totally inconsistent with Menger, Mises and Hayek. Her interest in economic history is totally inconsistent with Menger and Mises and she never once mentions, banks, fractional reserve banks, or central banks. Her emphasis on dignity seems to resonate with Hayek’s idea of ‘cultural evolution’ and her distinction between inventors and innovators is pure Schumpeter.

In the final analysis McCloskey’s critique of the standard explanations for the Industrial Revolution is excellent and the fact that she is asking the right questions in economics is also laudable. However, her answers are contradictory and confused. Instead of following the evidence, she tries to cram her preconceived ideas about economics onto the evidence, including the irrational radical subjectivism of the Austrian School of Economics.

  
  

## Matt Ridley: Libertarians vs Classical Liberals on Patents and Inventors

  
  

The libertarian crowd has been at the forefront of the anti-patent crusade. It is important to understand that libertarians are not consistent with the classical liberals, such as the founding fathers and Locke. I have been looking for a way to illustrate this. Then I ran across a [Wall Street Journal article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-basic-science-1445613954) by Matt Ridley, a darling of the libertarian crowd, which illustrated the differences perfectly. The [article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-basic-science-1445613954) ostensibly was about government funding of science. I am sympathetic to the thrust of the article, however, in the second paragraph he states:

“Suppose Thomas Edison had died of an electric shock before thinking up the light bulb. Would history have been radically different? Of course not. No fewer than 23 people deserve the credit for inventing some version of the incandescent bulb before Edison, according to a history of the invention written by Robert Friedel, Paul Israel and Bernard Finn.”

This struck me as a very odd paragraph in an article on government funding of science. Edison was not funded by the government. Mr. Ridley and the people he cites may have never worked in fundamental research or with inventors. This may result in a misunderstanding of the differences between various inventions that lay people group together, which is the case with the paper cited in the article.

Ridley’s sole argument about Edison rests on the idea that other people were working on the problem. Thousands of people have tried to solve Fermat’s last theorem since 1637. Does that mean Andrew Wiles proof in 1994 was inevitable? Alternatively, only Edwin Armstrong worked on and invented FM (frequency modulation). Does that mean FM was not inevitable?

The article does stop there however, it goes on to denigrate the work of almost every great inventor and scientist since the Enlightenment, concluding with the statement:

“Simultaneous discovery and invention mean that both patents and Nobel Prizes are fundamentally unfair things. And indeed, it is rare for a Nobel Prize not to leave in its wake a train of bitterly disappointed individuals with very good cause to be bitterly disappointed.”

Ridley is not just attacking government funding of science, he is contending that discoveries and inventions are equally likely, given a range of researchers. If you take the statement above literally, it means that everyone working in technology and science are robots.

However, Ridley provides no evidence for his position and ignores the large variations in the rate of scientific advancement and inventions in both time and geography. This is not surprising, as Mr. Ridley did the same thing in his book _The Rational Optimist_, where he claims that most inventions were never patented, however a simple fact check showed that every invention he mentions is the subject of numerous patents.

The excellent book, [The Most Powerful Idea in the World](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036S49WS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1) by William Rosen, shows that the Industrial Revolution, which was really an explosion in new inventions, was the result of property rights for inventions, i.e., patents.

One of the differences between classical liberals and libertarians is that classical liberalism celebrates great people, particularly those who used reason in the areas of science and technology. The Enlightenment was about celebrating the power of reason and rejecting faith and determinism. Thomas Jefferson said the two of the greatest people in the history of the world were Isaac Newton and John Locke.

Perhaps Ridley’s position is not shared by most libertarians. Yet, a recent [panel discussion on Reason TV](https://reason.com/reasontv/2015/10/20/a-skeptics-guide-to-ip), part of the libertarian magazine Reason, shows Ridley’s position is widely shared. One panelist compared patents to slavery and taxi medallions. Another panelist made Ridley’s point that most inventions were never patented. But, if you eliminated everything in your house that was subject to a patent or made by a process that was once patented, your house would not exist. Most people will quickly understand that all the electronics would be gone, but so would the refrigerator, the electrical power, and even the glass in your windows was subject to patents extending back to Venice.

It would be easy to brand such an anti-intellectual property as arising from jealousy or self-aggrandizement, however, I think that would be a mistake. These libertarians are pushing a version of F. A. Hayek’s cultural evolution. Hayek’s ideas on cultural evolution are based on the impotence of reason. Hayek argues, that the demand for rational, conscious (“political”) control of the concrete particulars of social life is based upon a misunderstanding of the process of cultural evolution and on a hubristic and dangerous overestimation of the capacity of the conscious reasoning intellect.”[201](#sdfootnote201sym)

Ridley is just applying Hayek’s ideas on cultural evolution to science and technology. He is not the only one; the libertarian/Austrian economist Peter Lewin from University of Texas at Dallas, sadly my alma mater, makes a similar point. He emphasizes that most technical knowledge is tacit knowledge which is something we know but cannot prove or of which we are not conscious. In other places Lewin discusses “social knowledge” which appears to be tacit knowledge we hold collectively. Both Lewin and Hayek are fans of David Hume, who said causation does not exist (or cannot be proved) and induction is invalid or could not be proven valid. For many libertarians the anti-induction, anti-reason David Hume, is a hero.

Classical liberals know that causation exists, that Induction as a methodology, is not only valid, but the source of _all_ knowledge. The most important value to a classical liberal is Reason. They understand that there is no such thing as social knowledge or knowledge of which we are not conscious. Classical liberals understand each person’s mind functions independently and therefore they celebrate great inventors and scientists. They know that without these great people, it is entirely possible that we would still be living in the Dark Ages. One only need look at North Korea, Cuba, or the Middle East to understand that technological progress is not inevitable and is not the result of some determinist spontaneous order.

What is interesting if you look closely at the arguments of Ridley, Hayek, and Lewin is that they are collectivist at an epistemological or cultural level. Their argument against a centralized government appears to be that it distorts this collectivist acquisition of knowledge.

Classical liberals and libertarians both appear to support free markets or capitalism. Beyond this they diverge, especially for the modern beltway libertarians. Classical liberals base their support of capitalism in reason and natural rights, which are discovered by reason. Libertarians base their arguments for free markets based on collective acquisition of knowledge that is disrupted by government interference.

Libertarians often align themselves with Ayn Rand, and claim her as one of their own, however, their ideas are incompatible with Rand’s. Rand herself was highly critical of the creed of Libertarianism, calling them “hippies of the Right.” If Matt Ridley had written [Atlas Shrugged](http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand-ebook/dp/B003V8B5XO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1446153422&sr=1-1&keywords=atlas+shrugged&refinements=p_n_feature_browse-bin%3A618073011), the economy would have hummed along based on spontaneous order and John Galt would not be a genius inventor.

  
  

## Capital in Disequilibrium: The Austrians’ Answer to New Growth Theory

  
  

This book, [Capital in Disequilibrium: The Role of Capital in a Changing World](http://www.amazon.com/Capital-Disequilibrium-Role-Changing-World-ebook/dp/B006E8ZZHU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441744203&sr=8-1&keywords=capital+in+disequilibrium) by Peter Lewen, is supposed to be Austrian Economics’ answer to “new growth theory”, which recognizes that new human knowledge is the most important component to economic growth. As opposed to the “old” ideas on growth which claimed economic growth was the result of increases in land, labor, or capital. Old school growth theories focus primarily on increases in capital. Perhaps the two biggest figures in new growth theory are Robert Solow and Paul Romer. Robert Solow won the Nobel Prize in economics for his econometric study showing that technological change was the key driver in the US economy. Sadly he then said technological change was not part of the study of economics, it was like background radiation and beyond our control. Paul Romer takes over from Solow by making technological change part of the study and policy recommendation of economics.

This book suffers from many of the same problems other economists who have explored new growth theory have had. They attempt to graft the findings of new growth theory onto their preconceived ideas about economics. For example, Robert Solow is a Keynesian so he has attempted to just tweak Keynesian ideas to fit this new information, instead of understanding that this new information required a whole new look at and approach to economics. Paul Romer is what I would call a “mathematical Keynesian” and is also trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

This book attempts to take the finding s of new growth theory and meld them into Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT).[202](#sdfootnote202sym) ABCT claims that economic growth is the result of increases in capital/savings. There is no evidence that increases in savings or capital in anyway result in economic growth and plenty of evidence to the contrary.[203](#sdfootnote203sym) Pasting some of the ideas of new growth theory onto ABCT neither solves the problems with ABCT nor adds anything to new growth theory.

The author’s ideas on scientific and technical knowledge come from Karl Popper, who has argued that knowledge is impossible. This is not surprising as it is consistent with Hayek’s ideas of cultural evolution, which argues that reason is limited and it is conceit to suggest that anyone can use reason to determine a correct societal structure. Both Hayek and the author are fans of David Hume (See Lewin’s youtube “Peter Lewin on [Austrian Capital Theory - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiBrw6IsK94)”). David Hume you will remember said causality was an illusion and brought us the supposed “is ought” problem in ethics. In other words, Hume attacked the very basis of reason, logic, and ethics. Hume is part of the Scottish Enlightenment, which elevated emotions above reason. The Scottish Enlightenment underpins all of Austrian Economics. The other philosophical tradition behind the Austrians is philosopher Franz Brentano who raised the psychology of the person to a primary.

It is not surprising then that the author concludes “**The superior performance of capitalist economies cannot be logically ‘proved.’**” Under the author’s ‘implications for policy’ section we get this,

“It involves not only, or primarily, the addition of existing capital equipment but rather the introduction of progressively more technically advance equipment, the production of which is made possible by an institutional environment in which the discovery of such technical advances is encouraged.”

Interestingly enough the author never explains what encourages technological advances and he never even mentions property rights for inventions, i.e., patents. Even Solow and Romer realize that they cannot ignore patents, however contrived their arguments are for dismissing them.

One of the reasons the author ignores patents is that he emphasizes what he calls “tacit knowledge.” Tacit knowledge is something we know but cannot prove or of which we are not conscious. This is perfectly consistent with the Austrian ideas that reason is limited or ineffectual. As a result, he talks a lot about innovation and never mentions inventors. He talks about organizations, but never individuals. He talks a lot about production and ignores invention. Austrians like to scream they are capitalist or free market, but they are certainly not pro-individualistic. This is not surprising as this would require a commitment to the power of the individual mind to understand the world. The author further reveals his collectivist ideas when emphasizes that the knowledge that is important to the economy is “social knowledge.” The Austrians are collectivists. They believe central planning interrupts the functioning of the process of gaining “social knowledge.”

This book does not contribute anything to new growth theory. The only reason to read this book is to better understand the underlying principles of Austrian Economics, which are not pro-reason, pro-individual, or pro-capitalism (The economic system that occurs when the government protects individual rights.)

It is time to quit pretending that Austrians are pro-capitalists, because that would require being pro- individualist and pro-reason. Austrians are collectivists just like the Marxists and Keynesians, just with a different spin. They think inalienable rights (natural rights) do not exist, which is consistent with their collectivist ideology. They constantly attack and mischaracterize John Locke’s ideas on property and the facts and logical structure of patents and all forms of intellectual property. Their attacks are reminiscent of constant faking of data by anthropomorphic global warming advocates and prove a deep seated contempt for reason and reality. Because they think natural rights are nonsense they have no respect for the US Constitution or the legal principles underlying it. They also ignore the very foundations of capitalism and what caused the industrial revolution. It is time for Austrian Economics to go on the scrapheap of history, just as it is time for Marxism and Keynesianism.

  
  

## Milton Friedman: Advocate for Freedom?

  
  

I have been criticized for pointing out that Austrian Economics, particularly Menger, Mises, and Hayek, is not consistent with reason, science, or Natural Rights and therefore not consistent with Capitalism. In this article I am going to apply the same standards to Milton Friedman, who is also often cited as a great advocate of freedom and capitalism.

Milton Friedman won the Nobel Prize in economics and is not part of the Austrian School of Economics. He is often classified as a monetarist or part of the Chicago School of Economics. I think the latter is more accurate. Ayn Rand was no fan of Friedman. She criticized his belief that economics must be morally neutral. In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoeOAxFcLbg), Rand states that Friedman is not an advocate for Capitalism and an enemy of Objectivism.

  
  

Epistemology

Milton Friedman laid out his ideas on epistemology in the essay "[The Methodology of Positive Economics" (1953)](http://www.sfu.ca/~dandolfa/friedman-1966.pdf). Some experts claim that the essay was a big influence on the Chicago School of Economics. In this article he essentially argues for a pragmatic approach to epistemology, which boils down to if a model (theory) is predictive it is correct.

Friedman's methodology, which appears to justify the eclectic and pragmatic view that economists should use any model that appears to “work” regardless of how absurd or unreasonable its assumptions might appear, has been deployed in service of a rigid theoretical orthodoxy.

[Philosophy of Economic](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/#3.2)s

Friedman argues that economic models are generally judged by the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions/propositions, however he thinks this is incorrect.

In so far as a theory can be said to have "assumptions" at all, and in so far as their "realism" can be judged independently of the validity of predictions, the relation between the significance of a theory and the "realism" of its "assumptions" is almost the opposite of that suggested by the view under criticism. Truly important and significant hypotheses will be found to have "assumptions" that are wildly inaccurate descriptive representations of reality, and, in general, the more significant the theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions (in this sense).

[The Methodology of Positive Economics (1953)](http://www.sfu.ca/~dandolfa/friedman-1966.pdf)

It is easy to show Friedman’s pragmatism is mistaken. Copernican Heliocentrism with its epicycles of the planets was highly predictive, but it was not science. In science/engineering this is known as a heuristic model. Heuristic models are often created by curve fitting the observed data. They predict how a system will work within very narrow circumstance, but do not explain the underlying physics (causes). As a result, heuristic models cannot be extended or built upon, when people attempt to do so they lead to false conclusions.

Friedman’s epistemology boils down to pragmatic “pure empiricism”, which means he accepts the evidence of his senses, but denies logic and concepts. Friedman disconnects assumptions/propositions from the results of the model, which is an attack on logic. An analogy would be that it might make no sense that doing a rain dance causes it to rain, but our empirical evidence says that it is predictive of whether it rains in the next couple of days so it is a good theory. As a result, we are supposed to ignore that there is no causal relationship between the rain and the rain dance.

Friedman’s epistemology is anti-reason. In one case Friedman argued that we need freedom because of this epistemological uncertainty. “I have no right to coerce someone else, because I cannot be sure that I am right and he is wrong.”[204](#sdfootnote204sym) This is a common position of libertarians and Austrians – lack of knowledge requires freedom. This position not only undercuts all of science, it removes reason as the foundation of ethics, political philosophy, and law. It is also unadulterated nonsense.

  
  

Science

Friedman is not proposing to do science, he is proposing to collect data that never leads to knowledge. Science is based both on reality and reason/logic. Friedman wants to ignore the reason/logic side of science. While Friedman has different reasons for not proposing to do science, he is otherwise consistent with the Menger, Mises, and Hayek in rejecting science in economics. Ultimately, Friedman’s ideas on science are just a rehash of Karl Popper’s misguided concept of science.

  
  

Ethics

Friedman is consistent with the Austrians in suggesting that economics must be value free – that is devoid of ethics. Friedman argues in his paper [The Methodology of Positive Economics](http://www.sfu.ca/~dandolfa/friedman-1966.pdf), that for a discipline to be a science it must be free of moral judgments. However, Friedman appears to making a finer distinction of where ethics fits in science and particularly in economics.

Positive economics is in principle independent of any particular ethical position or normative judgments. As Keynes says, it deals with "what is," not with "what ought to be."

[The Methodology of Positive Economics](http://www.sfu.ca/~dandolfa/friedman-1966.pdf)

First, science requires a profound set of ethics that are unique in history. This ethics requires reporting the data accurately,[205](#sdfootnote205sym) follow the data to its logical conclusion, and never ascribing non-natural causes to the observations.

Second, imagine taking Friedman’s point of view in the science of medicine. Medical doctors are not there to deal with ought to be, just to observe what is. Are doctors biased in their observations, because they bring ethics into their science?

The question of ethics in economics disappears if the correct fundamental questions of economics are defined and therefore the definition of economics is properly defined. The most fundamental question of economics is: What is the source of real per capita increase in wealth? This leads to the correct definition of economics which is the study of how man obtains the things he needs to live. **This puts the focus on human well-being, just like medicine**.

Economists who pretend that they are not injecting ethics into economics are really pushing utilitarianism, often summed up as ‘the greatest good for the greatest number’. This always leads to disaster. In the short term the greatest good for the greatest number always weighs in favor of taking the property of those who create and giving it to those who do not, for instance. In fact, many philosophers who push utilitarianism also push socialism. The counter is usually that stealing people’s property is not good in the long run, but this argument rarely wins over most people.

I searched if Friedman ever mentions Natural Rights or Locke and never found anything. This is not surprising as he explicitly rejects ethics, at least in economics, and implicitly accepts utilitarianism.

Friedman is inconsistent with the founding principles of the United States, inconsistent with Objectivism, and not an advocate of Capitalism, which is the economic system that occurs when a country protects people’s Natural Rights.

Friedman, in my opinion, is highly influence by the philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment, which would not be surprising as Adam Smith is in this group and also Jeremy Bentham, one of the big proponents of utilitarianism. [206](#sdfootnote206sym) The Scottish Enlightenment philosophers were also highly skeptical of the efficacy of reason.

  
  

Source of Economic Growth

Friedman did not write much about what causes real per capita increases in wealth. I assume he accepted the standard neo-classical idea that increases in capital were the cause of economic growth. This does not fit the empirical evidence. Friedman’s lack of interest in the question is damning. Although, he did focus his attention on what inhibits economic growth.

Friedman spends almost no time discussing inventions or inventors. Inventions are the only way to increase real per capita incomes and define the upper bound on the standard of living in any given period of time. The fact that Friedman ignores them shows incredibly poor judgment.

  
  

Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution was the first time in history that real per capita incomes started to grow consistently. Friedman’s only comment about the most important event in the history of economics was that the idea of robber barons was a myth. This is not what I would expect of a scientist, however Friedman was clear that he was not doing science.

  
  

Conclusion

Milton Friedman hardly fares any better than the Austrian Economists. Personally, I think his writing is much better than the Austrians and he is more likeable, which seemed to be part of his success in spreading his ideas.

Friedman’s ideas are inconsistent with reason, science, or Natural Rights and therefore not consistent with Capitalism. He is not proposing to do science and undermines reason with his pragmatism. However, unlike the Austrians, Milton Friedman’s supporters are not actively undermining property rights in his name.

  
  

## Austrian Economics: Not Just Wrong

  
  

Numerous Objectivists and well-meaning advocates of freedom are surprised when I show them that Austrian Economics is not a pro-reason, pro-freedom, intellectual movement. When I show them what the Austrians are saying, they make all sorts of excuses for the Austrians, including that the Austrians do not mean what they are saying, that these errors do not affect the excellent economic work the Austrians have done, and that these problems are limited to a small minority group of Austrians. It is time that we take a good look at what Austrian Economics says and examine whether we want to lend our good name to this movement. Below I discuss some of the common talking points.

  
  

1) Patents

The Austrians have been at the center of the anti-patent movement. They argue that patents hurt the economy and slow down technological progress. The wealthiest countries in the world have the strongest patent systems; almost all new technologies are developed by the countries with the strongest patent systems, the Industrial Revolution started in countries with the first and strongest patent systems and those countries with the strongest patents systems correlate well with their economic freedom index. If a socialist ignored this amount of overwhelming macroeconomic evidence, we would vilify them.

However it is worse than just ignoring the evidence, Matt Ridley, author of the Rational Optimist and darling of the Austrians, is an example of how the Austrians are willing to lie to win their points on patents. Ridley makes the claim that technological progress does not require patents and then cites a number of technologies that were never patented. His book (Rational Optimist) states that a number of inventions were never patented, p. 264, such as automatic transmission, Bakelite, ballpoint pens, cellophane, cyclotrons, gyrocompasses, jet engines, magnetic recording, power steering, safety razors and zippers. Five minutes of competent research shows that all these technologies are subject to numerous patents. The case of Bakelite shows that Ridley is not just incompetent, but a liar. A simple internet search shows that chemist Leo Hendrik Baekeland (1863-1944) invented and first patented the synthetic resin that we know as Bakelite in 1907.[207](#sdfootnote207sym) I have made this point publicly and I have heard no apologies or retractions from Ridley or the Austrians. The Austrians do not even appear bothered by this blatant lie, they continue to repeat the essence of the lie whenever they get a chance.

If Al Gore did this we would ridicule him. But when it comes to the Austrians, we stand aside and make excuses for them. It is worse than that, because the Austrians are part of a machine to manufacture lies about patents faster than they can be refuted. See Adam Mossoff’s paper on point [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/11/19/repetition-of-make-them-true/id=63302/](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/11/19/repetition-of-make-them-true/id=63302/). Note, that this is exactly the technique AGW environmental Nazis use.

Liars should not be trusted at all and it turns out the Matt Ridley has doubled down on his lies. In an article in the Wall Street Journal he states:

“Simultaneous discovery and invention mean that both patents and Nobel Prizes are fundamentally unfair things. And indeed, it is rare for a Nobel Prize not to leave in its wake a train of bitterly disappointed individuals with very good cause to be bitterly disappointed.” [http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-basic-science-1445613954](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-basic-science-1445613954)

What Ridley is saying is that Nobel Prize winners and inventors are frauds. He states that “technological evolution has a momentum of its own.” Ridley is saying that scientists and inventors do not create anything, society does. Ridley is not just a liar- he is EVIL. Where did Ridley get these ideas? They are straight from F.A. Hayek’s “Cultural Evolution.” Ridley is not alone or anomalous among the Austrians. Reason Magazine, the Cato Institute, Foundation for Economic Education, and the Wall Street Journal have all joined in to propagate the Austrian lies to promote their anti-patent agenda.

Diedre McCloskey is another Austrian Economist that denigrates the work of inventors, engineers and scientists, suggesting that technological progress is on auto-pilot. These attacks are exactly the same anti-achievement, anti-reason attacks you get from the left. They sound like James Taggart from Atlas Shrugged:

’He didn’t invent smelting and chemistry and air compression. He couldn’t have invented HIS metal but for thousands and thousands of other people. HIS Metal! Why does he think it’s his? Why does he think it’s his invention? Everybody uses the work of everybody else. Nobody ever invents anything.’ (Jim Taggart) She (Cheryl) said, puzzled, ‘But the iron ore and all those other things were there all the time. Why didn’t anybody else make that Metal, but Mr. Rearden did?’”

This Austrian position is a repackaging of Hayek’s Cultural Evolution. This vicious attack on human greatness is not a minor flaw or error.

  
  

  
  

2) Reason and science.

  
  

Mises: The Austrians are clear that praxeology and their economic theories are not based on empirical evidence.

“[Praxeology's] cognition is purely formal and general without reference to the material content and particular features of the actual case. Its statements and propositions are not derived from experience. They are, like those of logic and mathematics, a priori.” Mises, _Human Action_, p. 32

“All theorems of economics are necessarily valid in every instance in which all the assumptions presupposed are given.” Mises, _Human Action_, p. 66

“Apart from the fact that these conclusions cannot be “tested” by historical or statistical means, there is no need to test them since their truth has already been established. Historical fact enters into these conclusions only by determining which branch of the theory is applicable in any particular case.” Murray N. Rothbard [https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics](https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics)

  
  

You can find Austrians (Mises) saying this all over and supporting it. If the Austrians (Mises branch) are using evidence to reach their conclusions, then they have to admit praxeology is wrong. If praxeology is right, then you have to admit that they are not using empirical evidence. There is no middle ground here. Science requires that we test any propositions against reality as does reason.

  
  

Hayek: These Austrians are clear that reason is impotent.

“According to this theory, rules, norms and practices evolve in **a process of natural selection operating** **at the level of the group**. Thus, groups that happen to have more efficient rules and practices tend to grow, multiply, and ultimately displace other groups. The theory, of which Hayek himself was proud, is on all accounts central to his economic, social, and political project.” (Emphasis Added) [http://institutoamagi.org/download/Angner-Erik-The-history-of-Hayeks-Theory-of-cultural-Evolution.pdf](http://institutoamagi.org/download/Angner-Erik-The-history-of-Hayeks-Theory-of-cultural-Evolution.pdf)

“Burke and Hayek, then, shared a common enemy as well as a common understanding: **Enlightenment rationalism**. Perhaps the most characteristic attribute of Enlightenment thought was its cavalier dismissal of ‘irrational’ tradition as mere superstition and prejudice.” (Emphasis added) [http://www.nhinet.org/raeder.htm](http://www.nhinet.org/raeder.htm)

According to Hayek, **reason was not the driving force behind cultural evolution**, but rather co-evolved in the course of this process. (Emphasis Added) [http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/staff/horst-feldmann/feldmann-2005-hayek-theory-of-cultural-evolution.pdf](http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/staff/horst-feldmann/feldmann-2005-hayek-theory-of-cultural-evolution.pdf)

“Hayek tells us that that rationality (he does not explicitly distinguish between either ""reason"" and ""rationality"" or ""reasonable"" and ""rational"") is ""**no more than some degree of coherence** and consistency in a person's actions, some lasting influence of knowledge or insight which, once acquired, will affect his action at a later date and in different circumstances."" Hayek also maintains that behavior guided **by habit, custom, and tradition is rational** in the sense that such behavior is not contrary to intelligent action.” [https://home.isi.org/hayek-role-reason-human-affairs#sthash.1zV4WFR9.dpuf](https://home.isi.org/hayek-role-reason-human-affairs#sthash.1zV4WFR9.dpuf)

“Hayek's argument is primarily **directed against certain epistemological** views that he associates with the philosophy of Rene Descartes and **the Enlightenment**, views he labels ""constructivist rationalism."" For Hayek, the constructivist mentality is characterized by 1) belief in a socially autonomous human reason capable of designing civilization and culture; 2) a radical rejection of tradition and conventional behavior; 3) a tendency toward animistic or anthropomorphic thinking; and 4**) the demand for rational justification of values**.” [https://home.isi.org/hayek-role-reason-human-affairs#sthash.1zV4WFR9.dpuf](https://home.isi.org/hayek-role-reason-human-affairs#sthash.1zV4WFR9.dpuf)

“This tradition is characterized, moreover, by an evolutionary perspective that conceives social institutions and practices—law, morals, money, the market mechanism, habits, language—**not as products of conscious construction or enlightened invention but of a suprarational trial-and-error** process of cultural evolution.” [https://home.isi.org/hayek-role-reason-human-affairs#sthash.1zV4WFR9.dpuf](https://home.isi.org/hayek-role-reason-human-affairs#sthash.1zV4WFR9.dpuf)

“However, Hayek seemingly came to doubt there could be any such thing as properly constructed rule of law.” [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friedrich-hayek/#LawEcoNic](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friedrich-hayek/#LawEcoNic)

“In his philosophy, Hayek relegates reason to a minor role. He argues for a modest perspective of people’s reasoning capabilities. He contends that reason is passive and that it is a social product.” [http://www.rationalargumentator.com/index/blog/2015/08/rand-hayek-comparison/](http://www.rationalargumentator.com/index/blog/2015/08/rand-hayek-comparison/)

  
  

Hayek’s writings on cultural evolution are long winded and therefore do not make for clear quotes. This is not surprising when people are arguing against reason they are often long winded, such as Kant. When the Supreme Court writes a long opinion you can be sure that they are not using reason and attempting to bury the irrationalism of their argument in lots of words.

It is clear from the quotes above and related papers (most by Hayek supporters) that Hayek thinks that reason cannot be used (is impotent) to understand any social institutions. At best Hayek is saying that reason is useful in the limited sphere of hard sciences. If so this is just a variation on Kant.

If the Austrians (Hayek) are using reason as the Austrian apologists argue, then they have to abandon the whole idea of cultural evolution. If CE is right, then the Austrians are rejecting reason. Hayek was clear that Cultural Evolution (CE) underlies all his ideas in economics. If CE is wrong then Hayek’s whole case for freedom falls as does his ideas on spontaneous order. His ideas on spontaneous order require Natural Rights, which Hayek rejects.

We have to take people’s ideas seriously. The Austrian fans are always making excuses for why Hayek, Mises, Menger, etc. don’t mean what they are saying. When we are reviewing socialist ideas, such as Keynes, we hold Keynes not only responsible for what he said, but the logical conclusions of what he said.

It is a logical contradiction to use words to be against reason and therefore most people are polite or generous and assume that the Austrians do not mean what they are saying. This is fine in casual conversation, but when people are writing about their ideas you have to take them at their word.

Mises and Hayek are both rejecting reason from different points of view. This is not surprising because the intellectual tradition of Austrians is David Hume. Hume is perhaps the worst anti-reason philosopher in the last 300 years. Hume and Adam Smith were great friends. Hayek is a straightforward extension of the Hume- Smith line of irrationalism. Menger and Mises follow a slightly different path of Hume to Franz Brentano, who elevates emotions to the level of epistemological absolutes. Hume and Smith did the same thing.

Apologists for the Austrians always suggest that I am making huge leaps without evidence. If I said that Keynes is the product of the Kant-Marx line no one would suggest that I am making outrageous leaps. Intellectuals are responsible for not only exactly what they say, but also the logical conclusions of what they say. Just because Austrians spout that they are for free markets does not mean that we can hold them to a different standard than the socialists.

  
  

3) Are the Austrians Really for Free Markets?

Menger pushed the following ideas: (1) public works constructed by the state such as roads, railways and canals. (2) government established agricultural and vocational training institutions (Menger 1994: 123). (3) government subsidies to certain sectors. (4) state intervention to stop clearing of forests on private property in the mountains of Austria when this clearing had serious and bad effects on agriculture. (5) government intervention to stop child labour (Menger 1994: 129), according to this article [http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.mx/2012/08/rescuing-menger-from-austrians.html](http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.mx/2012/08/rescuing-menger-from-austrians.html).

Hayek was willing to make all sorts of compromises with the idea of free markets, because he was committed to Cultural Evolution, not reason and not Natural Rights. For instance, he was for the government providing everyone with a “Basic Income” according to this article [http://www.libertarianism.org/columns/why-did-hayek-support-basic-income](http://www.libertarianism.org/columns/why-did-hayek-support-basic-income).

In this quote Hayek argues for mandatory insurance. “Once it becomes the recognized duty of the public to provide for the extreme needs of old age, unemployment, sickness, etc., irrespective of whether the individuals could and ought to have made provision themselves, and particularly once health is assured to such an extent that it is apt to reduce individuals efforts, it seems an obvious corollary to compel them to ensure or otherwise provide against those common hazards of life.” _The Constitution of Liberty_ (1960)

Mises supports fire regulations according to this article [http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.mx/2010/10/was-mises-socialist-why-mises-refutes.html](http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.mx/2010/10/was-mises-socialist-why-mises-refutes.html).

The claim of Austrians that their founders are for a pure free market is absolute nonsense.

  
  

4) What Are the Supposed Great Achievements of the Austrians?

I am constantly told that the Austrian Economists made great contributions to economics, whatever their other faults. Other than Menger’s Marginal Utility, Hayek’s flawed ideas on Spontaneous Order, and perhaps Mises’ insight that War does not create prosperity, I am unaware of any other great economic contributions by the Austrians to economics. I have asked numerous Austrians to name the great economic contributions of the Austrians and they are never able to actually name any.

What the Austrians were good at was criticizing socialism and Marxism. The ability to criticize is not the same thing as the ability to put forward good economic theories.

Here are a number of errors that Austrians make in economics. They claim that fractional reserve banking creates money out of thin air. This position is absurd and makes Austrians look like Flat Earthers. The Austrian Business Cycle Theory does not fit the empirical facts and even some Austrians have admitted so in academic papers. Of course this does not matter because empirical evidence is irrelevant (Mises) or we cannot use reason to analyze our own world (Hayek). The Austrians obsession with the Fed (Central Banks) as the cause of all recessions results in them ignoring other important facts in the economy and creates a mystical obsession with Central Banks. The Austrians position on Property Rights is not only wrong, it undermines capitalism and the law.

  
  

5) Ayn Rand on the Austrians.

Rothbard: Rothbard is the father of the anarcho-capitalism movement. Rand described it as “a naive floating abstraction”.

Hayek: Ayn Rand in her marginalia launched a nasty attack on Friedrich von Hayek calling him, among other things, a “God damn fool” and a “vicious bastard.” (Mayhew, ed., Ayn Rand’s Marginalia, pp. 149 and 151.)

Mises: Rand called him the greatest living economist. However, Branden appeared to speak for himself and Ayn Rand says:

“We must take the gravest exception, for example, to the general doctrine of praxeology; to the **assertion that all value-judgments are outside the province of reason, that a scientific ethics is impossible; to the disavowal of the concept of inalienable rights; and to many of the psychological view expressed**.” (Branden 1963b, 34) _The Journal of Ayn Rand Sutidies Vol. 6 No. 2._

According to Branden, Rand’s comments in the margin of Human Action were highly critical of Mises works. Branden, _The Passion of Ayn Rand_.

What Rand admired about Mises were his criticisms of socialism and Marxism.

  
  

Rand’s overall evaluation of the Austrians is damning. Rand was initially attracted to some of the Austrians. This only proves she was human. Thus, it is not surprising that many Objectivists are initially attracted to the Austrians, as was I. .

What is interesting is that most Austrians understand that Objectivism is incompatible with Austrian Economics, but many Objectivists have not figured this out.

  
  

  
  

6) Conclusion

  
  

Austrian Economics is not just wrong, it is actively working against Freedom, Capitalism, Science, and Reason. The case against Austrian Economics is overwhelming.

-Austrian Economics rejects and denigrates the intellectual achievements of inventors, engineers, and scientists.

-Austrian Economics rejects and actively undermines reason and science. (The modern Austrians are happy to lie to promote their positions.)

-Austrians are not defenders of the United States Constitution.

-Austrians undermine property rights, the law, and Natural Rights.

-Austrian Economics actively undermines the idea of a rational Ethics.

-The great Austrian Economists were not defenders of free markets and capitalism. They were quite willing to allow government interference in the market, if it fit their goals.

-Austrian Economics pushes a number of economics theories that are laughably wrong.

  
  

If we hold the Austrians to the same standards we do for the socialists, we see that they are essentially the same.

  
  

## Why Austrian Economics Subjectivity is Wrong and Condemns Economics to Being a Pseudo-Science

  
  

I was having a discussion with an Objectivist colleague about the Austrian Economic idea of subjective value. In economics the subjective theory of values (STV) was developed in response to the classical economic ‘labor theory of value’. The labor theory of value states that the value of an item is equal to the sum total of the labor that went into making it. Thus the value of your computer is equal to the total amount of labor used to produce it, including all its components.

The Austrians, particularly Carl Menger, explained that this was clearly incorrect. In response he said the value of a thing is determined by each person’s own mind. Most economists today adhere to some sort of subjectivist theory of value.

Ayn Rand, in Capitalism for the Unknown Ideal, discussed the differences between intrinsic, subjective, and objective theories of value. In my opinion it was her way of making it clear that she disagreed with her friend Ludwig Von Mises.

  
  

The subjectivist theory holds that the good bears no relation to the facts of reality.

…

The intrinsic theory holds that the good resides in some sort of reality, independent of man’s consciousness.

…

The objective theory holds that the good is … an evaluation of the facts of reality … according to a rational standard of value.

(Ayn Rand Lexicon “What Is Capitalism?” Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, 21)

  
  

The Subjective Theory of Value (STV) in economics results in economics being a subjective social ‘science’, instead of an objective, true science. It is important that we define what Austrians’ mean by the STV. They mean that people’s economic choices are not connected to reality. People have subjective values that they attempt to fulfill and we cannot say whether a person’s economic choice is correct or rational.[208](#sdfootnote208sym)

According to the STV we could not say that if Robinson Crusoe’s choice to trade his canteen of water for a gold doubloon to the only other survivor of a shipwreck, when there is no potable water on the island and no foreseeable chance of rescue before Crusoe dies of dehydration and no foreseeable chance of rain before Crusoe dies of dehydration, is irrational. We cannot even make this decision if we know that Crusoe’s goal is to stay alive and he has no connection to the other survivor.

If we take the STV seriously, then I can be rich if I just subjectively believe that my slum house in a decaying part of Detroit is worth $200 million. Value is all subjective, so as long as I firmly hold to this belief then I will suddenly be wealthy. Pointing out to me that the market value of my house is only $15,000 is founding your opinion “upon an arbitrary judgment of value.”

Unfortunately, the Austrian STV turns economics into a popularity game. As a result the only reason John Galt’s motor has any economic value is that other people value it. This is obvious nonsense. Galt’s motor has economic value even if no one else subjectively values it. The motor produces almost unlimited electrical power for almost zero marginal cost. Thus it has economic value to Galt, even if no one else is smart enough to see its value or take advantage of its value.

You will often hear Austrian economists describe why someone became wealthy in terms of a popularity contest. They rarely discuss the value that the wealthy person created, instead they talk about how the wealthy person made so many people happy. If wealth creation is just the result of an arbitrary popularity contest, then there is no logical reason that we should not redistribute wealth.

  
  

The macroeconomic evidence does not support the idea that people make arbitrary economic decisions. The wealthier people are the longer they live on average. If peoples’ decisions were truly subjective (disconnected from reality) then we would expect that there would be no correlation between wealth and longevity at least for those people living above the subsistence level. But in fact, there is a strong correlation. There is also a strong correlation between wealth and a number of factors related to the quality of life. This shows that people are not spending their money arbitrarily (subjective valuation), but spending it on things that enhance their longevity and their life.[209](#sdfootnote209sym)

![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu33757577_tmp_1cbdd549541992c1.jpg)

  
  

Some people suggest that once people are above the subsistence level of living then economic decisions become subjective. The evidence does not support this point of view either. People who are wealthier tend to drive safer cars, have better built houses that can withstand natural disasters better, have better access to high quality health care and so on. Very few people are wealthy enough to afford the highest quality goods and services for the rest of their lives. Clearly, the wealthier people are the more they can afford to indulge some of their whimsies, however if they make enough irrational economic decisions they will not only go bankrupt, they will die – see Venezuela.

Wealthier people are also happier. There are some old studies that attempted to show that additional wealth/income above a subsistence level did not increase people’s happiness (The Easterlin Paradox). However, more recent studies have shown that increasing levels of wealth do correlate with increasing levels of happiness.[210](#sdfootnote210sym) The original studies were clearly biased and trying to make a political point.

Several of the ideas of Austrian economics are actually inconsistent with the STV[211](#sdfootnote211sym) For instance, how Austrians explain marginal utility implicitly shows that they understand peoples’ economic decisions (values) are not arbitrary. The most common way Austrians explain marginal utility is to explain that if they have one unit of water per day they will use if for drinking. If they suddenly have two units of water per day they will use the second unit for watering their garden, which they value lower than drinking. If they then find they have three units of water per day, then they will use the third unit for washing.

Why do Austrians always select drinking for water as having the highest priority? Clearly they inherently understand that people have to drink to stay alive (an objective – reality based decision) and that drinking water is more important than washing if the person wants to live.

Another example is the Austrian Business Cycle (ABCT). ABCT argues that we grow wealthier when we invest in (purchase) “higher order goods”, which is just a fancy way of saying increasing our capital. Thus they are arguing that purchasing capital goods has a higher value (economic and moral) than purchasing consumer goods. Some Austrians recognize the contradiction and try to dance around it by saying that economics can tell you what the result of certain policy actions will be, however economics cannot tell you which choice you should make. This is like a doctor telling you that a poison will kill you, but the physician cannot tell you that you should not ingest it.

Economic and moral values are not separate and cannot be isolated. Both are based on the objective nature of man. Austrians by choosing a STV for economics are logically compelled to the conclusion that ethics is subjective.[212](#sdfootnote212sym) The STV also condemns economics to the category of a social ‘science.’ Only by rejecting the STV and replacing it with an objective theory of value can economics be an objective science.

  
  

## The Austrian Business Cycle Debunked

  
  

This video, [The Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle | Roger W. Garrison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR-Tta3Pm28), from the Von Mises University does a good job of explaining the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT). The key point is that increasing the rate of savings (capital) results in increased economic growth in the future. The theory was worked out by Von Mises and Hayek. The foundation of the theory is very similar to classical economics, which held that economic growth was the result of increases in capital. The video has a number of charts and graphs to make it look more scientific, however no empirical evidence is provided to support the theory. Other work may provide empirical evidence, but I know of counter evidence as well.

This article will first discuss ABCT of recessions and some small errors in the theory. Then I will show that ABCT is incorrect about what causes economic growth and its failure to explain economic history, particularly the Industrial Revolution.

Austrians are always focused on showing that Keynes economic theories are wrong, and they are certainly right about this. Austrians argue that there is a trade between investment and consumption, which they call the sustainable Production Possibilities Frontier. Keynesian theory would say there is no difference between consumption and investment. Certainly there is a trade between investment and consumption. The Keynesians argue that by eating your seed corn you will be wealthier. However, a minor problem with ABCT is that it equates savings with investment. The two are not necessarily the same.

ABCT then states that recessions are caused by Central Banks (the Federal Reserve in the US) arbitrarily lowering interest rates below the market rate, which causes mal-investment and reduces the saving rate. Unless we narrowly define saving as putting money in a bank, savers have a number of choices which are not directly affected by the Federal Reserve chaning the interest rates. For instance, savers can put their money in stocks or corporate bonds. The return on stocks and corporate bonds is more related to the success of the underlying company than the interest rate set by the Central Bank, so the disincentive to save is not a strong as suggested by the ABCT. The second question is why does this cause mal-investment but increased saving does not. In both cases the investment intermediary is a commercial bank. Now if we were talking about direct government spending then the case is clear. In that case the government is not subject to the market. However, commercial banks are subject to the market. If interest rates are lower because of additional savings or because the Central Bank set them lower does not change their loan approval process. In addition, the ABCT completely ignores tax and regulatory policy. Are Austrians really saying that recessions can only be caused by Central Banks setting interest rates too low? Why not too high? This is why Austrians are obsessed with what Central Banks are doing and seem somewhat oblivious to other issues.

These are not my real complaints with the ABCT however. My real complaints are 1) recessions happened before there were Central Banks and 2) economic growth is not caused by increases in capital. Central Banks are a fairly new creation and fractional reserve banks did not exist in the world until around 1650s. The United States did not have a Central Bank until 1913, but there were recessions before that in the US. There were certainly recessions in the world before there were banks, including one huge one called the Dark Ages (There were banks in Rome and before, but almost none during the Dark Ages). ABCT fails to explain the source of all recessions, including the recession of 2001.

ABCT is also wrong on what causes economic growth. Robert Solow did an econometric study of the US economy to determine how much of the growth was due to increases in labor, how much was due to increases in capital, and how much was due to increasing levels of technology. According to Wikipedia

[This] technique has been applied to virtually every economy in the world and a common finding is that observed levels of economic growth cannot be explained simply by changes in the stock of capital in the economy or population and labor force growth rates. Hence, **technological progress plays a key role in the economic growth of nations, or the lack of it**. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_accounting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_accounting)

Robert Solow won the Nobel Prize in economics for this work. (This is not an endorsement of everything Solow says)

I would change the bolded part to state that the only way to obtain real per capita increases in wealth is through increasing levels of technology. This becomes more apparent if you look over longer timeframes. If we had the same technology as our ancestors in 1600, even with today’s total capital, would we be any wealthier than our ancestors? We would not live longer, we would not be able to produce any faster, the only difference might be that we had more savings to fall back on or disseminate existing technologies. However there was very little technological change at the time, so the increase in technological dissemination would have been small. As a result, we would be essentially no wealthier than our ancestors. **Our standard of living is defined by our level of technology**.

Note that the ABCT does not account for technological change. As a result, the theory should hold up in a technologically static world. However, this is totally inconsistent with economic history. The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain and the United States. There is no evidence that these countries had larger savings or capital stocks than say France or China or Holland or Japan. The Industrial Revolution was really a perpetual invention machine, driven by inventions not by capital. The source of all wealth is the human mind. The application of the human mind to problems of survival is called inventing, which is how we increase our technological level.

Austrian Business Cycle Theory does not hold up under scrutiny. Austrians have misidentified the source of economic growth and have a defective model for what causes recessions. Naturally they prescribe the wrong medicine since they do not understand the underlying mechanism. Austrian Economics is not pro-capitalism, it is not consistent with the enlightenment, reason, and science, which I have described in other posts.

  
  

  
  

PS: I mentioned above that the Austrians misdiagnosed the recession of 2001. They love to say that Greenspan created a bubble economy, which implies that in fact there was no real economic growth in the late 1990s. The narrative that Greenspan created a credit bubble by holding interest rates too low does not fit the facts. The economic growth of the late 1990s was built on new technologies that have made our lives immeasurably better. Real incomes and industrial production rose significantly in the late 1990s. In addition, the effective Fed funds rate in the late 1990s was between 5.5 and 6.5%, which looks tight by today’s standards. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was stable. There was an inverted yield curve in 2000, which happened as Greenspan was increasing interest rates. The commodities index was falling slightly in 1999 and rose slightly in 2000. M1 was essentially flat in the late 1990s and M2 was growing slowly. The evidence is overwhelming that the recession of 2001 was not caused by Federal Reserve “printing” too much money. In fact the evidence points to the idea that Greenspan was too restrictive and caused an inverted yield curve in his desire to cause the stock market to cool off, which caused the recession. It is true that the stock market had gotten ahead of earnings, but recent experiments in economics show this is a common with new investors and is not necessarily the result of easy credit.

  
  

## Conflating Inventions (Technological Progress) with Capital in Economics

  
  

Will Thomas and I gave a talk on Austrian Economics at Atlas Summit 2016, where I pointed out that Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT) does not fit the empirical facts. ABCT claims that increasing savings/capital are the cause of economic growth, which is very similar to what classical and neo-classical economics states. I pointed out that in fact it is increasing levels of technology (inventions) that are the cause of economic growth (and capital increases) not increases in capital. One of the questioners after the talk stated that inventions (technology) are part of capital.

Many people want to conflate increasing levels of technology with capital, however they are not the same. Capital as used in economics means those durable goods used in production.

In economics, capital goods, real capital, or capital assets are already-produced durable goods or any non-financial asset that is used in production of goods or services.

Adam Smith defines capital as "That part of a man's stock which he expects to afford him revenue". [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics))

The article goes on to explain how to determine if something as capital.

Classical and neoclassical economics regard capital as one of the factors of production (alongside the other factors: land and labour).

This is what makes it a factor of production:

• The good is not used up immediately in the process of production unlike raw materials or intermediate goods. (The significant exception to this is depreciation allowance, which like intermediate goods, is treated as a business expense.)

• The good can be produced or increased (in contrast to land and non-renewable resources). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics))

Technological change is not a good it is the process of inventing. It is true that when these new inventions are reproduced (manufacturing) then when purchased they may become capital, but that is several steps removed. If we treat technological change as just part of capital then going out and purchasing capital goods is the same thing as inventing. However, the results are not the same. Purchasing (acquiring) capital without invention results in no real per capita increases in wealth over the long run. As a simple example, assume that every farmer in the U.S. has the latest most up to date tractor their land can use. Adding more tractors (capital) does not increase the output of these farms. The same is true for capital in general.

A number of economists have pointed out that increasing levels of capital are not responsible for the tremendous economic growth experienced in the West since the Industrial Revolution. Among these economists are Robert Solow, Paul Romer, and Deirdre McCloskey. They all point to increasing levels of technology as the cause for our increased wealth. Our standard of living is defined by our level of technology.

On the other hand inventing at a faster rate does produce real per capita increases in wealth. Inventions can produce returns that are staggering. For instance, Eli Whitney’s invention of the cotton gin provided a forty times increase in the output of cotton in the U.S. in one decade.

In science it is important to isolate the factors affecting an experiment. For instance, if you conflate wind resistance and gravity then you end up with the nonsense that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. This means you will never be able to create a parachute or an airplane.

In economics if we conflate inventions with capital, we make the mistake that third world countries will become wealthy if we provide them capital. In fact, this is exactly what Development Economics has said for years despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Conflating these two concepts will cause us to ignore the role of property rights for inventions as being the biggest long term driver of wealth and instead focus on capital gains taxes or increasing the savings rate or increasing consumption.

Inventions are the cause of real per capita increases in wealth, not capital. Conflating the two is illogical and results in nonsensical economic policies.

  
  

## The “Great Ideas are Dime a Dozen” Myth

  
  

There is a popular myth that great ideas are a dime a dozen (see [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/amyanderson/2013/03/14/ideas-are-a-dime-a-dozen-people-who-implement-them-are-priceless/#1fdf2df3304b), [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/ideas-are-a-dime-a-dozen-execution-is-all-that-matters-2010-10), and [here](http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2006_2nd/Jun06_GoodIdeas.html)). I don’t know what a great idea is. Is a Dick Tracey watch or a nuclear powered rocket a great idea? No, not if you don’t know how to implement them, then it is just a fantasy and unless you have plot with it, it is not even a good fantasy story. However, I do know what a great invention is and they are not a billion dollars a dozen. A great invention takes incalculable intellectual skill, years of training, years of hard work, and significant resources.

[Pendulum of Justice](https://www.amazon.com/Pendulum-Justice-Hank-Rangar-Thriller-ebook/dp/B00EUNA7YC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1467071034&sr=8-1&keywords=pendulum+of+justice#navbar), the first Hank Rangar Thriller, discusses this exact point.

“Hey Mike—we’ve heard your ‘good ideas are a dime a dozen’ speech before. The electric light bulb, the cotton gin, the polio vaccine, the microcontroller, hell, the CAT scan, were all a dime a dozen”

It is my opinion that this sort of nonsense is usually spread by people in finance, who are looking to improve their negotiation position or are just too intellectually challenged to really know when an invention is great. It also inflates their self-importance.

The reality is that most people do not create much more than they consume in their lifetimes and this includes many people in finance, even if they personally get rich. It is only by raising our level of technology that we increase our per capita wealth and only inventors increase our level of technology. Great inventors create incalculable wealth and even if they become wealthy, what they receive in payment is a pittance to what they provided.

I think this nonsense of “great ideas are a dime a dozen” is a spin out from the Austrian Economist Joseph Schumpeter who made a nonsensical distinction between innovation and invention, while denigrating inventions and inventors.

According to Wikipedia:

Following Schumpeter (1934), contributors to the scholarly literature on innovation typically distinguish between invention, an idea made manifest, and innovation, ideas applied successfully in practice

There is nothing inherently wrong with the distinction above, but the way it is applied blurs together a number of different skills. Blurring skills together shows a misunderstanding of the process of innovating. Broadly speaking, innovation can be broken into two distinct sets of skills: creation and dissemination. By creation I mean creating something new, not production – creating something old.

A subset of creation is invention. An invention is a creation with an objective repeatable result. A creation that is not an invention has a subjective result, such as the effect of a painting on a viewer, or the effect of a book on a reader. Many activities combine both a subjective creation and an invention, such as architecture. However, we can separate out the invention from the other creative elements and this helps our understanding of the process.

Dissemination may include a number of processes, such as education (marketing, sales), manufacturing, finance, and management. This is not to say that marketing cannot be creative, it clearly often is very creative. However, the creative part of marketing can be separated out from the dissemination or execution part of marketing. The same is true of manufacturing, which can definitely include inventing. But an invention related to manufacturing is part of the creation step not part of the dissemination step.

Finance can also have inventions. For instance, the invention of a fractional reserve bank is clearly an invention. It has the objective result of securitizing assets and turning them into loans and currency. A fractional reserve bank will securitize land and turn it into a loan and currency. Despite this, it is important to understand that the first person to develop the fractional reserve bank is inventing and the person operating the fractional reserve bank is disseminating.

All real per capita economic progress is the result of inventing. This is not to say that it is unnecessary to disseminate inventions, but **if there were no new inventions there would not be any economic progress.** We would be stuck in static world once all the inventions had been completely disseminated. Of course, if we stop all dissemination activities we will quickly starve to death.

It is my opinion that business and economic professors have focused on “innovation” instead of “invention” because they have no idea how to invent or how the process of inventing works. They concentrate on what they know, i.e. business and economic practices.  As a result, the focus is on dissemination, under-appreciating the importance of inventing. In addition, it results in misleading business theories, such as:

– Management teams are more important than the quality of the invention.

– Execution is everything; patents and other IP do not matter.

– Get Big Fast.

The validity of these rules of thumb is directly related to the strength of the patent laws at the time the company is created. When patent laws are weak, these theories are more successful and when patent laws are strong, these rules are less true. Unfortunately, when patent laws are weak these ideas do not overcome the disincentive to invest in risky new technologies. **Management teams do not build revolutionary or disruptive technologies, they just disseminate these technologies.** These sorts of teams are like large companies and generally can produce a return with less risk by NOT developing high-risk technologies. They tend to focus on incremental technologies or on stealing someone else’s technology. While this may be good business advice in a period of weak patents, it is bad for our country’s competitiveness and our standard of living.

Technological progress (i.e., inventing), in the long run, is the only competitive business advantage. The best management team in the world selling buggy whips at the turn of the century could not overcome the technological advance of the automobile and stay a buggy whip company. The best management team in the world selling vacuum tubes in the 1940s, could not overcome the advance of transistors and semiconductors. This country is littered with companies that had great management teams that were overwhelmed by changes in technology. For instance, Digital Computers had a great management team, but they could not overcome the advance of the personal computer. Digital Computers, Inc. failed to invent fast enough to overcome the onslaught of small inexpensive computers. US steel was not able to overcome the onslaught of mini-mills, aluminum, and plastics. This was not because they did not have a good management team, it was because the management team under- prioritized invention and over-prioritized execution or dissemination skills. Ford & GM have not become walking zombies because they did not have strong management teams, but because they have not invented. As a result, they have antiquated production systems and weak technology in their products. 86% of the companies in the Fortune 500 in 1959 are no longer there. Some of these companies disappeared because of bad management, but **most companies disappeared because they did not keep up with changing technology**. In other words, they did not invent.

Inventions(i.e., advances in technology) are the ONLY WAY to increase real per capita incomes and the only long term business advantage.

This book explains that U.S. innovation has been declining since the ‘90s. Innovation is the only method of obtaining real per capita growth. Since 2000, we have passed a number of laws and regulations that are killing innovation in the US. The incredible innovation of the ‘90s was based on technology start-up companies built on intellectual capital, financial capital, and human capital. All three of the pillars have been under attack since 2000. ![](file:///tmp/lu337572qt.tmp/lu33757577_tmp_b3a2983538919e3d.jpg)

The number of permutation would be 118!, which is a number with 4 followed by 194 zeros. In reviewing other writings by Romer, it appears the author of the article forgot to include some of the limitations in Romer’s statement.

[32](#sdfootnote32anc) Romer prefers the word “recipes” to “inventions” perhaps because he believes the word invention implies all the complex definitions of patent law. However, I believe this leads to confusion. An invention that is never realized in physical form is meaningless. Once it is realized in physical form, it has at least some of the rivalrous features of physical property.

[208](#sdfootnote208anc) If human action always aims at a purpose, which by definition it does, then human action must be rational, that is, consistent with reason or guided by one's will and intellect. **It can never be termed irrational**.

  

In making this point, Mises in Human Action (p. 19) writes "Human action is necessarily always rational. The term 'rational action' is therefore pleonastic and must be rejected as such. **When applied to the ultimate ends of action, the terms rational and irrational are inappropriate and meaningless.** The ultimate end of action is always the satisfaction of some desires of the acting man."

  

Seemingly irrational action is rational, that is, has an aim. To appraise it as irrational, the appraiser merely imposes some other external source of value. Mises writes (p. 104): "However one twists things, one will never succeed in formulating the notion of 'irrational' action whose 'irrationality' is not founded upon **an arbitrary judgment of value.**"
