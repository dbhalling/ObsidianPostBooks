I have been predicted that the United States is suffering a brain drain. I have reported on this phenomena several times including my post Phil the Expat [http://hallingblog.com/phil-the-expatriate-how-the-u-s-is-driving-technical-talent-away/](http://hallingblog.com/phil-the-expatriate-how-the-u-s-is-driving-technical-talent-away/), which discusses a highly skilled scientist moving to Belize and Exodus From the US [http://hallingblog.com/phil-the-expatriate-how-the-u-s-is-driving-technical-talent-away/](http://hallingblog.com/phil-the-expatriate-how-the-u-s-is-driving-technical-talent-away/), which discussed a person with strong marketing and computer skills moving to Argentina. Well I now have another story to add to the US brain drain. I just meet a person who was a professor at an Ivy League school in the school of Medicine. He has decided to move to New Zealand to start a company around some new technology he has developed for the medical field. Just over a decade ago it would have been inconceivable that you would leave the US to create a technology startup. Now SOX has killed off the venture capital market in the US and the patent system is so bogged down that you company can die a thousand deaths before the Patent Office issues a patent. We are no longer the land of opportunity for highly skilled and motivated people. This is a bad sign for the US economy and for our future.
