I ran across this quote from Sir William Blackstone, in his Commentaries of the Laws of England, which was basis for US law at its founding, and was struck by the similarities. What do you think?

  

  

In his _Commentaries_ Sir William Blackstone opined that  _"The public good is in nothing more essentially interested, than in the protection of every individual's private rights."_  

  

  

There is no such thing as “the public interest” except as the sum of the interests of individual men. And the basic, common interest of all men—all rational men—is freedom. Freedom is the first requirement of “the public interest”—not what men do when they are free, but that they are free. All their achievements rest on that foundation—and cannot exist without it.
