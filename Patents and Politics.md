Most patent attorneys, I believe, would like to believe that patents are pure and have nothing to do with politics. However, the historical evidence shows that patent law is political. For instance, the FTC waged a war against patents and America’s businesses with their nine no-no’s of patents in the seventies. The intellectual roots of this attack on patents in the US is the advent of Antitrust law. The debate over patents is ultimately a debate over property rights. It should come as no surprise that the Marxists and environmentalists are against property rights, but what is surprising is the attack from supposed free market proponents such as the Cato Institute and the Austrians. These groups are against patents, because they believe property rights are not really rights at all, but just a convenient way of allocating scarce resources (Utilitarianism). I doubt Paul Ryan or most of the Republicans that supported the AIA are aware of these issues. But, they are either cynical enough to not care about patents or they have been infected enough by these supposed free market groups to be ambivalent about patents. Very few people truly understand the profound impact of patents on our economy - this includes most patent attorneys and inventors.
