Ever wonder why the US has a record number of people on food stamps now, why the median family income is declining, why the labor participation rate is the lowest since Jimmy Carter? You need look no farther than the fact that the US has fallen from 2nd or 3rd in 2000 in the Cato/Fraser index of economic freedom [http://www.cato.org/blog/continuing-us-decline-economic-freedom-world-index](http://www.cato.org/blog/continuing-us-decline-economic-freedom-world-index) to 17th. It is not just our economic freedom we are losing as the NSA and IRS scandals make clear. This is not just an academic exercise either. As the report makes clear longevity, access to medical care, education opportunities etc all deteriorate with a declining of economic freedoms.

  

The irony of this report is that the CATO Institute has been inconsistent at best about supporting property rights, which is the key issue underlying economic freedom. CATO has adopted a utilitarian basis for “property rights” that suggests they are just a useful artifact for efficiently distributing scarce resources. So in fact, they do not support property rights but property grants or privileges. This also means that they are confused that patents are not property rights. Patents are the single most important property right to economic growth, especially in a developed country. CATO is therefore in the position of being for property rights at an empirical level, but arguing against them on a philosophical level. Interestingly this also means that CATO is inconsistent about supporting our Constitution, which requires that Congress secure the rights of inventors to their inventions. No wonder the US is an economic basket case.
