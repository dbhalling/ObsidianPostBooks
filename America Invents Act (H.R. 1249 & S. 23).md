To Whom it May Concern:

  

As a patent attorney, author of the book _The Decline and Fall of the American Entrepreneur_, inventor and entrepreneur, I strongly oppose the passage of the Bill. Here are my reasons in bullet form:

  

1) Grace Period: This Bill makes the one year grace period meaningless. Proponents of the Bill state that the grace period is expanded and this is technically true. However, from a practical point of view the grace period will be meaningless. The bill states that an inventor can recover patent rights if he can prove that all other disclosures originated with the inventor—but the bill neglects to create a procedural forum for showing derivation in cases where the leak is not embodied in a patent application, or where the leak neglects to attribute the original inventor. As a practical business matter, the bill leaves no commercially-feasible grace period, an integral part of U.S. patent law since 1839. When you combine this with the First to File provisions an inventor will be forced to file immediately or risk losing their patent rights to anyone who hears about his invention. This will severely disadvantage individual inventors and startups.

  

There are two key papers, analyzing empirical data from Canada and Europe when they changed from a first to invent to a first to file, are:

2) Economy: This Bill is bad for the American economy. All real per capita increases in income are the result of increases in our level of technology. (See economists Paul Romer, Gregory Clark, and Robert Solow who received the Nobel Prize in Economics for essentially this point.) Startups and individual inventors create most of the emerging technologies. (See the SBA study “An Analysis of Small Business Patents by Industry and Firm Size” [http://archive.sba.gov/advo/research/rs335tot.pdf](http://archive.sba.gov/advo/research/rs335tot.pdf).) In addition, all net new jobs created in the U.S. since 1977 were created by startups. (See “Job Growth in U.S. Driven Exclusively by Startup, According to a Kauffman Foundation Study [http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/u-s-job-growth-driven-entirely-by-startups.aspx](http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/u-s-job-growth-driven-entirely-by-startups.aspx).) As explained above this Bill adversely affects startups and individual inventors who are the key to creating new technologies that result in high paying, high quality jobs.

  

3) First to File is Unconstitutional: Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution states:

  

To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

  

An inventor is a person who creates something new. The America Invents Act violates the Constitutional mandate. By changing our patent laws to a first to file rule, Congress is not securing the exclusive rights of inventors. It is taking rights from inventors and giving them to the person who games the legal system most effectively – files first.

  

Congress cannot just ignore the definition of inventor. This is not Alice in Wonderland. The inventor is the person who first creates something. As such there is no such thing as “first inventor to file.” There are inventors and people who copy or recreate the invention.

  

4) Fee Diversion: The House has removed the portion of the Bill meant to stop fee diversion. This makes the Bill a joke. Fee Diversion is an Unconstitutional direct tax. See Patent Office Fees an Unconstitutional Tax [http://hallingblog.com/2011/06/15/patent-office-fees-an-unconstitutional-tax/](http://hallingblog.com/2011/06/15/patent-office-fees-an-unconstitutional-tax/).

  

5) Another Post Grant Review: There will now be at least three different ways to challenge the validity of an issued patent. This creates uncertainty and weakens inventors’ property rights. It will allow large companies to spend startups into oblivion defending their patent rights.

  

6) Wall Street Give Away: The Act allows Wall Street banks to attack “business method” patents that they are infringing. This doesn’t extend to any other industry, only business methods—another Wall Street giveaway.

7) Carve Outs: The Act also includes special carve outs for Universities. Carve outs for Wall Street and Accounting Firms eliminating patents on tax strategies. If people are truly upset about tax strategy patents the answer is to reform our tax law, not to stop people from obtain property rights in their inventions.
