A recent study report on PatentlyO [http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2013/11/guest-post-paes-under-the-microscope-an-empirical-investigation-of-patent-holders-as-litigants.html](http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2013/11/guest-post-paes-under-the-microscope-an-empirical-investigation-of-patent-holders-as-litigants.html) clearly shows that President Obama and the histrionic chorus of the surge in lawsuits by Patent Assertion Entities (Mythical Patent Creations) is just not true. Changes in the law under the American Invents Act (AIA) that prohibited the joinder of defendants for the infringement of the same patent are the only reason for any apparent change and this know outcome of the AIA.
