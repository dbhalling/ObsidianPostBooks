The present economic doldrums (depression) is often blamed on lack of demand. For instance, I heard a news report that suggested lower interest rates will not help the economy because there is “lack of demand” for loans and it was implied that there was a lack of demand in the economy as a whole. The idea that there is ever a lack of demand, is economic stupidity. One of the defining points of economics is that it examines how **scarce resources are used to satisfy unlimited wants**. Did people stop wanting new cars, new cell phones, updated kitchens, to go on vacation, etc? - of course not. What has happened is that government has raised the cost of production through excessive regulation and taxes to the point that people cannot afford these things.
