There are people who are trying to steal the United State Declaration of Independence, not by taking the physical document, but by making it meaningless. This effort is lead by both side of the political aisle, but is being accelerated at an alarm pace by the Obama Administration. The arguments used to destroy the ideals found in the Declaration of Independence are also being used to destroy our patent system.

  

The Declaration of Independence contains three very radical concepts in the first part of the second paragraph reproduced below:

  

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed

  

These concepts are; 1) people are equal under the law, 2) people have the right to pursue their own happiness, and 3) government derives its power from the people.

  

People are Equal Under the Law

This is clearly not true in the United States today. For instance, if you gave a big enough campaign contribution to the Obama Administration you received special favors. See Solyndra’s $500M bailout. WilmerHale and The Medicines Company lobbied Congress for a special provision in the America Invents Act (AIA) that got WilmerHale out of a $200M malpractice case and extended the patent term for the drug Angiomax. Section 10 of the AIA was a special provision that only applies to Wall Street. This section essentially ensures that big Wall Street banks do not have to compete on innovation, they can just copy it. The eBay decision enshrines the idea that some people’s patents are worth more than other peoples. Like _Animal Farm_ some of us are more equal than others.

  

People Have the Right to Pursue their Own Happiness

This is a radical idea not found outside the United States. This idea is constantly under attack. President Obama tells us we are our brother’s keeper, implying that our reason for existing is to serve others. As the above statement by President Obama proves, the right to the pursuit of happiness is not a Christian concept and is not found in any other religion, country, or philosophy. The whole welfare state is an affront to this idea and shows that if you package slavery correctly people will happily enslaves themselves. In patent law we are constantly bombarded with the idea that once the idea is created, the inventor provides no value and should receive nothing. “Information wants to be free” we are told – inventors have no right to their happiness, they exist only to serve society.
