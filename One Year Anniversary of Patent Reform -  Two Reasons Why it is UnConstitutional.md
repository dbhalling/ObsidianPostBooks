A year ago the pork laden so called Patent Reform bill known as the America Invents Act (AIA) was enacted.

  

**First to File Provision:**

Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution states:

To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and **Inventors** the **exclusive Right** to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

  

The Constitution does not give Congress the authority to grant patents to the first person to file and doing so violates the exclusive Rights of inventors. The proponents of the AIA argue that it is really a First Inventor to File system, not a first to file system. This is nonsense. There is no such thing as being the second or third or ninth inventor. An inventor is the first one to create something.

**Fee Setting Authority:**

Article 1, Section 7, Clause 1 states.

  

All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills.

  

The AIA gives the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) fee setting authority. However, the part of the AIA that made sure that USPTO would be able to keep all its fees was removed by Representative Paul Ryan. Since it is very unlikely that the USPTO will keep all its fees, they are creating a bill for raising Revenue.
