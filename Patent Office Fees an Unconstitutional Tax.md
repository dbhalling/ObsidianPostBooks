Congressman Paul Ryan[1](#sdfootnote1sym) and Congressman Hal Rogers’ argument that ending Patent Office fee diversion is a sham. The Congressmen point to Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7, which states:

No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time

Does this clause support Ryan and Rogers point of view? The definition of appropriations is an act of a legislature authorizing money to be paid from the treasury for a specified use. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/appropriation](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/appropriation) The America Invents Act is an appropriation made by law for a specific use. So, their argument fails on its face. Ryan and Rogers further state that the America Invents Act moves billions of dollars of discretionary funding to mandatory funding. The only logical conclusion of Rogers’ and Ryan’s statement is that Patent Office fees are a tax. A tax is defined as a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tax](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tax) Patents are personal property[2](#sdfootnote2sym). So, if Ryan and Rogers believe that the money received by the Patent Office is nothing but general funds for the Treasury, which only a Washington insider could support this absurd point of view, then Patent Office fees are an Unconstitutional tax as I will explain below.[3](#sdfootnote3sym)

  
  

Patent Office Fees an Unconstitutional Tax

The Constitution has two sections that apply to how Congress can tax the people. Article 1, section 9, clause 4 states:

No capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.

This clause was modified, but not repealed by the 16th Amendment which states:

The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.

When these two sections are read together it is clear that Congress cannot establish direct taxes, except income taxes, without apportionment or enumeration. What is a direct tax? The definition of a direct tax according to Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_tax) is in the general sense, a tax paid directly to the government by the persons (juristic or natural) on whom it is imposed. In terms of the U.S. Constitution this means a tax on property "by reason of its ownership”. The [United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit) has stated: "Only three taxes are definitely known to be direct: (1) a capitation [ . . . ], (2) a tax upon real property, and (3) a tax upon personal property.”[4](#sdfootnote4sym) Patent Office fees are a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services, levied upon property (i.e., inventions/patents). This is a direct tax in the Constitutional sense because it is a tax on personal property. (Patents are personal property see 35 USC 261 [http://www.bitlaw.com/source/35usc/261.html](http://www.bitlaw.com/source/35usc/261.html)) It is thus clear that Patent Office fees, if they are a source of discretionary funds, are a direct tax on the people and they clearly are not apportioned among the several states and are levied without regard to any census or enumeration.

  
  

The Ryan/Roger’s Constitutional argument does not withstand even the most simple scrutiny. Fee Diversion is clearly Unconstitutional and amounts to fraud and theft on the part of Congress from inventors. Where are our so-called Constitutional scholars?

Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_tax): In the general sense, a direct tax is one paid directly to the government by the persons (juristic or natural) on whom it is imposed.

US Constitution sense: In the United States, the term "direct tax" has a different meaning for the purposes of constitutional law. Traditionally, a direct tax in the constitutional sense means a tax on property "by reason of its ownership.

[3](#sdfootnote3anc) The correct analysis of Patent Office fees is that they are held in trust by Congress, since the Patent Office is completely self funded.
