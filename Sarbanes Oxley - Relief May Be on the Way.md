I wrote about the damaging effects of Sarbanes Oxley in my book, The Decline and Fall of the American Entrepreneur [http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-text&field-keywords=the+decline+and+fall+of+the+american+entreprenuer&x=20&y=12](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-text&field-keywords=the+decline+and+fall+of+the+american+entreprenuer&x=20&y=12). It appears that the Republican presidential candidates have read my book. See this video [http://mercatus.org/video/j-w-verret-discusses-sarbanes-oxley-fox-news](http://mercatus.org/video/j-w-verret-discusses-sarbanes-oxley-fox-news), J. W. Verret Discusses Sarbanes-Oxley on Fox News, on the candidates explaining that we need to repeal SOX. Let’s hope that don’t just tinker around the edges with SOX and while they are at it they need to repeal Dodd Frank. This would be a big step toward restoring innovation and getting the economy growing again.
