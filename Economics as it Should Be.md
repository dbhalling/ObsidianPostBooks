I was giving a talk at Atlas Summit on ‘Economics, Evolution, and Rand’s Meta-Ethics’ and one person asked me how my ideas would alter economics. In my talks and in my book [Source of Economic Growth](https://www.amazon.com/Source-Economic-Growth-Dale-Halling/dp/1511829680/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1469292199&sr=8-1&keywords=source+of+economic+growth), I suggest that economics needs to be rethought from the ground up based on my findings. Here are some of the ways economics needs to be changed in order to make it a science.

  
  

1) Fundamental Questions of Economics

No school of economics is even ask the right questions. I have written another post on point ([Intellectual Capitalism: Part 1](/home/dbh/Documents/posts/Intellectual%20Capitalism:%20Fundamentals%20Part%201)), so I will not repeat all of it here.

Every science is defined by the questions it asks. According to a sampling of websites three of the major questions economics asks are:

1) What goods will be produced?

2) How will the goods be produced?

3) For whom are the goods produced?

All of these questions are inherently collectivist and in truly capitalist country (i.e., one that protects Natural Rights), all these questions lead to very boring answers. In addition, none of these questions are scientific questions (Just another example of how economics is not a science).

The single most important question in economics is:

**What is the source of real per capita increases in wealth?**

This immediately leads to the second most important question in economics today which is: What caused the Industrial Revolution? Both of these questions empirical and have objective answers.

The answer to the first question is inventions and this leads to a number of other important questions, such as how do we measure the rate of technological change, what things influence this rate, why Singapore appear to have a faster growth rate than Hong Kong despite a lower economic freedom index, are inventions subject to diminishing returns, etc.

  
  

2) Definition of Economics

Since economics is asking the wrong questions, it is clear that the definition of economics is incorrect. Here is my suggested definition of economics vs. standard definitions. Note that I have a whole chapter on this subject in my book [Source of Economic Growth](https://www.amazon.com/Source-Economic-Growth-Dale-Halling/dp/1511829680/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1469292199&sr=8-1&keywords=source+of+economic+growth).

Standard Definitions

Economics is a science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.

The science that deals with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, or the material welfare of humankind.

My Definition

**Economics is the study of how man obtains those things he needs to live.**

  
  

3) Cause and Effect in Economics

Classical, Neo-Classical, and Austrian economics emphasize manufacturing and trade, while Keynesian economics emphasizes consumption as the driver of economics and all of them are wrong.

**Invention Manufacturing Trade Consumption**

When man applies his reason to the problems of survival he invents. Production, which is really about reproduction or replication, is not the driver in economics as the questions from mainstream economics imply. Trade is also not the driver and in fact the Manufacturing and Trade steps are not absolutely necessary. Keynesian economics focuses on consumption, so it is on the far wrong side of the cause and effect chain.

Because Classical, Neo-Classical, and Austrian economics emphasizes the effects instead of the causes in economics they waste an infinite amount of time on supply and demand curves. Every supply and demand curve should come with two caveats: 1) demand does not create supply and 2) this chart assumes a technologically stagnant world. If demand could create supply then Keynesians would be right. What a supply and demand chart shows is that more people would be willing to sell their present stock at various prices, it does not show that anyone will produce anything.

  
  

4) Economics is not a Social Science its Foundations are in Biology and Evolution

Economics is not a social science it is a real science based on the biological facts of human existence. Specifically that we have to obtain a certain number of calories (calories here substitute well for all our needs, including oxygen, water, etc.) per day or we die. This gives us a physical definition of profit and loss. Modern economics treats the whole subject as if it was merely a game. Venezuela, North Korea, China, and the USSR prove that it is not.

For more information see [Economics, Evolution, and Rand’s Meta-Ethics (Intellectual Capitalism: Fundamentals Part 2)](https://hallingblog.com/2016/02/29/economics-evolution-and-rands-meta-ethics-intellectual-capitalism-fundamentals-part-2/)

This means that economics is a real empirical science. Neoclassical economics pretends to be an empirical science but too often they create mathematical models in which none of the variables are measurable. That is not science.

  
  

5) Perfect Competition

Perfect competition is an inherently flawed concept that has not place in economics. All conclusions based on perfect completion are wrong, including the whole
