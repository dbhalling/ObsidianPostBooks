Environmentalists are often portrayed by the Media as lovable, good natured people; people who only want to save some adorable furry creature. Environmentalist groups target new technologies claiming that they are dangerous or unproven. The policies they advocate are anti-innovation and have destroyed advances in medicine, food production, power generation, vaccines, and more. These policies have resulted in the deaths of more people than Hitler, Stalin, and Moa combined. These deaths are not the result of good intentioned policies gone wrong; these policies are the purposeful goal of environmental groups. Environmentalists have consistently proven that they are willing to lie in order to achieve their objectives. Being “Green” is worse than being a Nazi, worse than being a Marxist; but these policies do work hand in hand with these statists philosophies.

  

I will briefly outline three environmentalist policy areas where environmentalists have lied about science. and even more important than lying, these policies have killed millions of people.

  

**DDT**

  

_Silent Spring_ by Rachel Carson resulted in the banning of DDT.

  

Deaths Caused by DDT Ban

In 1970, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences estimated that DDT saved more than 500 million lives during the time it was widely used. [http://www.wnd.com/2004/07/25428/](http://www.wnd.com/2004/07/25428/) Banning DDT has resulted in about 100 million deaths, many of whom were pregnant women and children. By comparison: Hitler killed about 6-7 million, Stalin killed around 10-14million, and Mao killed between 60-68 million.

  

FYI: The ban on DDT is why the US is currently having infestations of bed bugs; most people born after 1940 thought these were eradicated like polio.

  

Lies about DDT

Carson claimed DDT thinned the eggshells of birds. This was based on 1956 study by Dr. James DeWitt, published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry. However, DeWitt’s study actually showed that 50 percent more eggs hatched alive from the birds subjected to DDT than the non-DDT group. Other claims suggested that raptor populations declined because of the use of DDT; however, raptor populations were failing before the introduction of DDT. In fact, the Audubon’s Eagle counts from 1941 to 1961 actually increased when DDT was mostly widely used. All the latest evidence shows, Carson’s claims were nothing but outrageous lies.

  

Goal of Banning DDT was to Kill People

  

Alexander King, founder of the Malthusian Club of Rome, wrote in a biographical essay in 1990:

  

“My own doubts came when DDT was introduced. In Guyana, within two years, it had almost eliminated malaria. So my chief quarrel with DDT, in hindsight, is that it **has greatly added to the population problem**.” [http://jiminmontana.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/environmentalism-the-green-religion-of-dehumanization/](http://jiminmontana.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/environmentalism-the-green-religion-of-dehumanization/)

  

Dr. Charles Wurster, one of the major opponents of DDT, is reported to have said,

  

“People are the cause of all the problems. **We have too many of them. We need to get rid of some of them, and this (referring to malaria deaths) is as good a way as any**.” [http://jiminmontana.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/environmentalism-the-green-religion-of-dehumanization/](http://jiminmontana.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/environmentalism-the-green-religion-of-dehumanization/)

  

  

**Nuclear Power**

  

Anti-Nuclear power activists claimed that nuclear power generation would result in the deaths of thousands of people. This movement was able to kill off the nuclear power industry in the United States after the Three Mile Island accident in which no one was killed and the average person within ten miles of the accident received the equivalent on one chest xray of radiation.

  

Deaths Caused by Nuclear Power Ban

The main alternative to nuclear power plants in the World ,to date ,have been coal fired plants. For each person killed by nuclear power generation (including deaths due to Chernoybal), 4,000 die from coal. The previous data is adjusted for how much power is produced by each method of power generation. [http://www.the9billion.com/2011/03/24/death-rate-from-nuclear-power-vs-coal/](http://www.the9billion.com/2011/03/24/death-rate-from-nuclear-power-vs-coal/) The number of people killed per year in the US because of this change is at least 10,000. These deaths are mainly due to particulate pollution(nuclear power has no particulate pollution). This figure also includes an increase in the number of mining deaths, and increases in the number of deaths due to the extra transportation required to move coal compared to transporting uranium. In the United States alone: this environmental program has resulted in at least 300,000 deaths. Why has this not made headlines??! While the rest of the world has not followed the U.S.’s lead completely, the anti-nuclear movement has definitely retarded the development of nuclear power plants around the world. As a result, a reasonable estimate of the deaths worldwide because of the environmental policies is at least 600,000.

  

Nuclear power plants represent a huge reduction in air and water pollution. Real reductions in pollution are the result of advancing technologies, not regulator schemes such as the EPA has adopted. In fact, regulatory agencies can be credited with increasing pollution levels compared to what it would be without their influence.

  

The largest one time event fatality toll from energy production was in 1975. 30 dams in central China failed in short succession due to severe flooding. An estimated 230,000 people died. The fatalities and property destruction from this single event in hydropower far exceeds the number of deaths from all other energy sources. [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20928053.600-fossil-fuels-are-far-deadlier-than-nuclear-power.html](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20928053.600-fossil-fuels-are-far-deadlier-than-nuclear-power.html) Of course, hydroelectric power is one of the environmentalists’ favorite source of power.

  

Lies about Nuclear Power

  

The number one lie is about nuclear power is that an accident could result in the death of thousands of people. Another boogey man of the environmentalists is that the half lives of byproducts from nuclear power lasts tens of thousands of years. What if the half life were infinite? Wouldn’t that be worse? If the half life were infinite, the element would be stable. Longer half lives mean that there is less radiation. Nuclear power plants accelerate the natural radioactive decay of uranium, so leftover fuel rods are less radioactive than the mined material.

  

Nuclear power plants are too expensive to make economic sense. This is another lie perpetuated by environmental groups.

_Nuclear power is not intrinsically expensive. What drove nuclear plant costs up were environmentalist delays (caused by anti-nuclear “interveners” and the high interest financing rates—both perpetrated by those who wanted to kill nuclear power, and who now complain that nuclear costs too much. Shown here, in dollars per kilowatt are the rising costs of financing, environmentalist delays, and construction materials increases for nuclear (N) and the rising costs for comparable coal-fired plants (C) with sulfur removal._

Goal of Banning Nuclear power was to Kill People?

There does not appear to be any environmental wacko comments to this effect; certainly it hasbeen the result and since the environmentalism movement believes there are too many people-well, it seems this was likely part of their goal in killing off nuclear power.

  

  

**Global Warming**

  

Man made global warming or Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) is the latest hoax being thrust upon us by Environmentalists, who I have already shown,have a very poor track record.

  

Deaths Caused by Global Warming Hoax

The United States is spending about $10 billion a year on Global Warming research. [http://frontpagemag.com/2011/01/28/the-black-hole-of-global-warming-spending/](http://frontpagemag.com/2011/01/28/the-black-hole-of-global-warming-spending/) I think it is safe to say that at least $100 billion has been spent worldwide on Global Warming over the last decade. It costs about $20 to provide infrastructure for clean water for one person. According to WHO, 30,000 deaths occur every week from unsafe water and unhygienic living conditions. Most of these deaths are children under five years old. That is over 600,000 deaths per year because of poor water infrastructure. If the $10 billion being wasted on Global Warming research were instead applied to water infrastructure, this could save 50 million lives. Why can’t we say that the Global Warming Hoax has cost the lives of at 6 million people.?

  

  

How AGW Advocates Have Lied

“The latest data released by the Met Office, based on readings from 30,000 measuring stations, confirms there has been no global warming for 15 years.” [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2096277/Global-warming-James-Delingpole-claims-green-zealots-destroying-planet.html#ixzz1xP61Eo2b](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2096277/Global-warming-James-Delingpole-claims-green-zealots-destroying-planet.html#ixzz1xP61Eo2b)

It is well known that the main driver of the temperature on Earth are the variations in the amount of solar energy the Earth receives. “Experiments at the CERN laboratory in Geneva have supported the theory of Danish physicist Henrik Svensmark that the sun — not man-made CO2 — is the biggest driver of climate change.” [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2096277/Global-warming-James-Delingpole-claims-green-zealots-destroying-planet.html#ixzz1xP61Eo2b](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2096277/Global-warming-James-Delingpole-claims-green-zealots-destroying-planet.html#ixzz1xP61Eo2b)

The biggest greenhouse gas is water vapor – over 95%, but you never hear about this from AGW advocates. [http://www.creators.com/opinion/walter-williams/environmentalists-wild-predictions.html](http://www.creators.com/opinion/walter-williams/environmentalists-wild-predictions.html)

“Natural wetlands produce more greenhouse gas contributions annually than all human sources combined.” [http://www.creators.com/opinion/walter-williams/environmentalists-wild-predictions.html](http://www.creators.com/opinion/walter-williams/environmentalists-wild-predictions.html)

  

Below, IPCC Experts comment on the IPCC, which is the group at the UN that has been saying a consensus of scientist s “believe” in Global Warming [http://ukipscotland.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/fifty-ipcc-experts-expose-global-warming-lies/](http://ukipscotland.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/fifty-ipcc-experts-expose-global-warming-lies/)  
  

Dr Vincent Gray: “The (IPCC) climate change statement is an orchestrated litany of lies.”

  

Dr. Lucka Bogataj: “Rising levels of airborne carbon dioxide don’t cause global temperatures to rise…. temperature changed first and some 700 years later a change in aerial content of carbon dioxide followed.”

  

Dr Richard Courtney: “The empirical evidence strongly indicates that the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis is wrong.”

  

Dr Eigil Friis-Christensen: “The IPCC refused to consider the sun’s effect on the Earth’s climate as a topic worthy of investigation. The IPCC conceived its task only as investigating potential human causes of climate change.”

  

Goal of AGW

The goal of AGW is to kill capitalism and as a result kill millions of people. Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace explained.

  

_(Environmentalism today is) more about globalism and anti-capitalism than it is about science or ecology…._

  

  

**The Environmental Movement is Anti-Human – Pure Evil**

  

“Ultimately, no problem may be more threatening to the Earth’s environment than **the proliferation of the human species**.”

“Today, life on Earth is disappearing faster than the days when dinosaurs breathed their last, but for a very different reason....**Us homo sapiens are turning out to be as destructive a force as any asteroid**. Earth’s intricate web of ecosystems thrived for millions of years as natural paradises, until we came along, paved paradise, and put up a parking lot. Our assault on nature is killing off the very things we depend on for our own lives....**The stark reality is that there are simply too many of us,** and we consume way too much, especially here at home....It will take a massive global effort to make things right, but the solutions are not a secret: control population, recycle, reduce consumption, develop green technologies.”
